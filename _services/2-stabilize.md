There are more applications out there that were created, and then left completely alone.
And then suddenly, new features are needed, and no one even knows the current status of
the app, much less what it will take to add those new features.  These apps need a good
once over, and a quick polish before you can get back to work. With the Stabilizer, we
include the full Rails Inspection PLUS
- fix any serious security issues that have entry points in your application
- add or update your application developer bootstrap (bin/setup)
- set up or update your CI build
- update to the latest Rails bug fix release (for your current point version)
