The dreaded Rails upgrade. Very few development teams ever enjoy this process. Why task
your team with a major infrastructure upgrade when our experienced Rails team are familiar
with the common upgrade pitfalls, and can perform that upgrade for you, faster and with fewer
hiccups along the way? We can identify the potential upgrade issues, and bring your
application up to date quickly and smoothly.

We will generally require an Inspection & Stabilization of your application before
embarking on any major version upgrades. With the information compiled by those
processes, we can provide an estimate with point-by-point details of the upgrade process
and potential issues before we start.

After your application is upgraded, you can take advantage of our monthly Rails
Renewal package to keep it up-to-date.
