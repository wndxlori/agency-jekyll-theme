The Inspection is a multi-point checkup of your Rails application. We'll identify any potential
security issues (including a summary of possible entry points), list which gems used in your
app need updating (or replacing), provide a test coverage report, and an initial code quality
evaluation.

[Contact us](/index#contact) today to get your Rails Inspection started
