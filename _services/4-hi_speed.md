Unfortunately, neglecting your application frameworks, libraries, and toolsets
comes at a cost. That cost is the slow build up of technical debt. Much like credit card
debt, that technical debt continuously erodes your teamâ€™s ability to deliver on those
priority features and bug fixes. As technical debt builds, so can developer frustration.

Let us start paying down that technical debt for you, so your application and development team
can get back on the fast track. We can address issues like
- those left-over bits of previous Rails upgrades that were never completed (simplifying your code base)
- removing code that is no longer used (simplifying your code, making refactoring easier)
- replacing gems at EOL (and their potential security issues)
- speeding up your test suite

[Contact us](/index#contact) and we can get started on a quote for your application(s).
