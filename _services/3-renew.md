After your application has been Inspected and Stabilized, let us take on your
monthly Rails app maintenance needs, ensuring that your app stays secure, and your gems
are kept up-to-date. These updates will be thoroughly tested, then made available as
pull-requests for your team to review before applying, or we can apply them for you.
We will also branch and test on new Rails point version beta-tests, ensuring your
application is ready to update as soon as a new GM release is available.
