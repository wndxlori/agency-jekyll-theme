Ok, don't shoot the messenger here. Read this whole next part BEFORE reacting to it.

What I believe we need is something more like a trade certification. Let's look for a moment at an electrician. My brother is an electrician, so I have some insight into this trade, if no actual experience. Apprenticeship for the electrician's trade is 4 years, with a minimum of 1500 hours of on the job training and 8 weeks of formal schooling for 3 years, and 1350 hours / 12 weeks in the fourth year.  Once completed, you become a journeyman, and can work unsupervised. (Ahem...) An additional 3 years of work (over a 5 year period) is required before being allowed to write the exam to acquire a Master's certificate.  That certificate is REQUIRED before you can pull electrical permits. (Ahem...)

So, that looks like 36 solid weeks of schooling, and 7 YEARS of practical, SUPERVISED, experience is required before you can formally work "without a net".

So, when I read about "senior" developers with 5 years of experience talking about reaching the pinnacle of their career, and not knowing where to go from there... I laugh.  Or maybe it's crying, I'm not sure.  When I read about company "founders" of similar levels of experience, I cringe. Not because they can't actually produce a workable product (because they can). I cringe at the thought of all the damage they are going to do along the way, as they learn about all the things they DON'T KNOW (cue Marvin laugh here), in the school of hard knocks.

What else would a method like trade certification do for us?  

P.S.  Before I leave the topic of certification, please note I'm not talking about these bogus industry-sponsored certifications-for-profit, either. In a previous life, I actually got my Java Programmer certification, and quickly figured out what a complete joke it was.  Anyone could have bought one of those cert-exam handbooks, crammed for a week or two, and passed that exam.  Doesn't mean you could program your way out of a wet paper bag, though. Yes, yes, the developer and architect ones were more rigorous. That doesn't undo the damage of the programmer one, however.
