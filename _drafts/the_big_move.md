#The Big Move

So, it's been over 6 months since we moved from Calgary to Lethbridge.  I still get a lot of comments and questions about our move, so I thought it was time to gather all the questions and answers together in one place.

First up, let's get this really annoying question out of the way...

`Did you retire?`

While I find that question annoying, and vaguely insulting, I do understand that people "moving out of the big city" tend to be retiring, so I'll just say...
Hell, no.  We're just not that old, and I can't imagine retiring and sitting around being bored for the next half of my life.  

Both Trever & I have always wanted to move away from the city.  His job, Unix sysadmin/network admin, more than mine, has been "hands on", requiring us to be within a reasonable commute to the office/data centre.  

As a contract software developer, I have had a certain amount of flexibility in the jobs I take, and the work I perform, so I have been migrating towards less and less "in office" and "on site" work, and more remote, where I can work primarily from home.  I like it that way.  I can concentrate better, with fewer interruptions.  It's more relaxing.  I can spend more time with my dogs. Get exposed to fewer germs. Etc.

And Trever has seen this, and has been slowly working towards joining me.  Most of the work he does IS remote.  He takes care of servers that are co-located at data centres all over the world.  If he needs to be hands-on, it's rare.  So, over time, he ended up working primarily from home as well.

At that point, it became obvious that we no longer HAD to be within an easy commute to downtown Calgary, so why would we not get moving?

Originally, we were planning on getting an acreage somewhere.  Trever's parents and sister & brother-in-law all have acreages, and I must admit, I saw the appeal.  I did insist, though, that we move south, not north, because neither one of us is a big fan of winter & snow, so why would we volunteer to get MORE snow.  

I grew up in Lethbridge, so I have first-hand experience with the fact that it's always just a little warmer, and there's always less snow down south.  Ok, there's wind, but that's a different story.

So, we were looking for acreages, south of Calgary, maybe as far south as Lethbridge.  After we started getting interested in specific areas and communities, we started investigating little details like high-speed Internet.  Because, remote or not, the one thing we needed to keep working from home was a really, really solid, fast Internet connection.  And you CAN get one out on an acreage.  But it costs something like $600/month.  Ouch.  Our other goal was to go mortgage-free, ors as close as we could get.  Volunteering for another mortgage-like payment lacked appeal.  So, we switched focus to in-town properties.  And that's how we ended up in Lethbridge.

Not only did I grow up here, but my parents live here, as does my brother & sister-in-law.  It was an easy choice to make, and so we made it.
