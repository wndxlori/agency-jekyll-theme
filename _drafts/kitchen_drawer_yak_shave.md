My in-laws came to visit last week and part of the visit turned into an epic yak shave, so I thought
I would share the fun. 

The primary reason for this visit was the acquisition of a "new to them" computer. Mom-in-law 
wanted to transfer her stuff to the new computer and leave the old computer to Dad-in-law. And, since this
is my husband the systems administrator we are talking about, Trever wanted to upgrade and back up both
computers as well. As you can imagine, this takes quite a while, and they planned to stay for a couple days.

While they were here, my father-in-law was trying to do things for us (to make up for all the work 
Trever was doing) and he got up early to make us breakfast Friday morning. In the 
course of making breakfast, he discovered our broken kitchen drawer.  We probably should have warned him. 
This is a drawer in our kitchen that has 
been broken in some way or other pretty much since we moved into this house over 5 years ago. 
Unfortunately neither my husband nor I are particularly handy with respect to woodworking or cabinetry, 
so we've just been putting up with 
this drawer that constantly threatens to fall out of the cupboard and dump all our cutlery all over
the floor. My father-in-law, OTOH, is very handy, so he decided he was going to fix it because 
it would be simple. It was SO not simple. 

First, I want to say, he did all the proper things. Took the drawer out, measured the whole thing, 
and measured the cupboard. The next thing he discovered is that the drawer, once extracted from the 
space, was fairly damaged on 
the bottom from all our years of using it improperly. There were splinters, so he also had to glue up 
the whole bottom of the drawer to take care of all those splinters, at which point he discovered we 
also didn't have any clamps, which would've been very useful.

So, he and mom-in-law went out and bought some clamps, and found a woodworking store, and bought new 
slides for the drawer.
 
After all the gluing and clamping was completed and dried out, he started with the slide installations.
Then it started to go wrong. Turns out this side-mount slide wouldn't fit on this type of drawer 
because these cabinets 
were made way back in the '80s. So, instead of getting everything installed on Friday night, he spent 
a good part of the evening looking at YouTube, lots of videos, doing a lot of Googling, and he found 
the right kind of slide that would work for these drawers. (Note, for the interested... bottom mount 
slides don't go on the bottom of the drawer... they go on the bottom edge of the SIDE of the drawer. 
Sheesh)

So go forward to the next morning, Saturday, and he went and found the right kind of slide, the 
undermount center slide, and started mounting it. Keeping in mind he had planned to go home on 
Saturday morning, but no, he was still  working on our drawer. He got this undermount center slide 
installed on the narrow piece of wood on the bottom of our drawer that seemed to be tailor 
made precisely for such an undermount slide. He got it all put together, 
started to hook it up underneath in the cupboard... and it fell off. 

You see, that piece of wood on the bottom of the drawer actually wasn't attached 
properly to the drawer. It had just been stapled and the staples had gone between a couple 
of pieces of wood instead of into the wood, and so with a bit of weight applied, it fell off. 
Now he had to take the drawer back 
out again, dismantle what he had put together and properly screw that piece of wood into the drawer. 
(Thankfully we did have some wood screws) 

Okay. This seems like a long story and it is, but it is also an excellent example of a story that illustrates -  
unintended consequences. You see, my father-in-law is an experienced woodworker and he thought, "Fixing 
a drawer, that'll be easy. I know how to do that." And he did, but it wasn't until he had the whole 
drawer out 
that he started discovering the problems with it and it wasn't until he had purchased hardware that 
should work that he discovered it wouldn't work because the drawer was too old and it wasn't until he 
started putting together the right piece of hardware on the drawer that he discovered that the original
drawer also 
wasn't put together very well. I think I missed the final part where, when he got everything mounted, 
he discovered the drawer wouldn't slide in because it was now sitting too high in the cupboard opening 
and the top 
edges of the drawer were hitting the cupboard face. Thankfully I did have a little jigsaw that he 
used to slice two tiny little pieces of wood out of the cupboard face to leave enough room for 
the drawer to slide in. 

There were SO many things that went wrong in this seemingly simple repair job. Kind of like when you
develop an app.

There's a lot of moving parts, and a lot of things that can go wrong, even when you are experienced. 
and you take all the pieces out and look at them thoroughly before you get started. And that's where 
my 6 pack apps course comes in. I'm going to guide you through all of the steps involved from having
your first app idea to having 
a successful app in the app store. I hope you'll come sign up for my early access list so  when it 
opens for enrollment again soon, you'll be first in line.
