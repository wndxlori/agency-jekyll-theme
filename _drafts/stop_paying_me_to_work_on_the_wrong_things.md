One thing that occasionally baffles me, as an experienced Ruby/Rails consultant, is the 
way in which clients hire people like me to work on their teams.

With my deep background of experience in Ruby and Rails, I get hired over and over to work 
on new application features.  This is baffling to me.  I come in with little to no domain 
knowledge and expertise, so someone has to bring me up to speed on that domain (taking time 
away from working on features).  And then I need to get to know the client(s) and what 
their needs are.  Then I can finally get to work on actual features. Seems like I get a 
free education in your application's domain space, while you are paying me the big $$$. 

Why are you paying me to do this? Why not have your existing developers (who already have 
all that domain knowledge) work on features, and let me at those problems that will help 
your entire team build more features, faster?  Like figuring out why your test suite is 
so slow (which drags down your entire team).  Or working on performance tuning of your 
application (which impacts all your clients, as well as the scalability of your 
application).  How about fixing all those potential security holes you've been ignoring, 
so you and your clients' data won't get exposed to the next hacker that finds out you 
are running with an old insecure Ruby/Rails/gem?
