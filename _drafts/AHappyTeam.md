A Happy Team is a Productive Team

Maybe the problem isn't that you need more developers, or that elusive ninja or rockstar.  Maybe you
need to make room in that budget for just a little bit more programmer happiness. 

##The rockstar fallacy
The cost of a ninja or rockstar is fairly astronomical.  First, there is the effort involved in your 
sunk time to come up with a job description.  Make no mistakes, this costs you both time & money. 
Then you have to figure out how much you will be willing to pay for this ninja.  Someone who recognizes 
they are a rock star will want a rock star salary, which will probably be AT LEAST 150% - %200 of what
you are paying your best not-a-ninja developer right now.  And the headhunter who finds that rock star 
will want their 20% cut of that salary. Seems like there are more costs involved than you might have 
thought.  

Did you ever think about taking a fraction of that money, and using it to boost the productivity and
happiness of the team you already have?  

##Increase programmer happiness
Software developers tend to be of a type. They like solving puzzles and problems. They love their 
technological toys. And they love learning new things.

#Switch it up
Working on the same things, day after day, week after week, year after year becomes monotinous and 
eventually frustrating. Even if you need that person working on that same thing, there is no reason
they can't be given interesting side projects to alleviate the "sameness".

##20% time
The notion of 20% time isn't that your team spends 20% of their time screwing around on fun things that
have no relevance to your business. You and your team should identify areas where you need more expertise.  
Send people on training; to conferences; online courses or tutorials. Identify technologies that you might
need in the future, and get people digging into those. List all your critical open source dependencies, and
have members of your team start contributing back.  All these things will 
1. Make your developers happier
1. Contribute to your company's bottom line in the future
1. Result in a team that is better and more skilled *every year*

###Developer Tools
I'm not sure why sometimes the development team manager chooses to be penny-wise and pound-foolish when
it comes to developer tools. If you are uncertain about what I mean you need to go back to that "cost of 
hiring" section, and think really hard about whether you are prepared to pay that, or 2x or 3x that, when
developers quit because they are unhappy.  Is that $500/yr service that your team is begging for REALLY
too expensive? Maybe the tool is REALLY expensive. Still, you have a simple answer. Get that developer to
use some of their 20% time to make the business case for why that tool is still worthwhile. At the end,
you'll either buy it or not, but your developer will be happy to be involved in making the decision, and
at the end you'll have a developer with a better understanding of economics, budgets and business cases.

Increase productivity

Take busy-work away
Don't waste valuable developer time rolling your own build server. That's why we have services like Travis CI
and Circle CI. As a startup, don't waste valuable developer time building out and customizing infrastructure.
That's why services like Amazon (what) and Heroku exist. Once you get to the point that these infrastructure
services no longer solve your needs, or are too expensive, you can start thinking about that.

Take time to work on improving the speed of your application test suite.
Testing is important. Most teams do it. But if your test suite is slow, people will either avoid running it 
(making it less effective) or will be wasting too much time twiddling their thumbs waiting for tests. 

Automate manual, error-prone processes
If your development process has not yet reached the pinnacle of continuous deployment, you have an opportunity.
An opportunity to improve a manual, error prone process. All you have to do is automate one step. And then 
another. And keep doing it until you get to CD.
