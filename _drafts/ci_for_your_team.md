#CI for your team

Now that we have seen the advantages and disadvantages of hiring a consultant, or hiring a rockstar developer, what alternatives are there?

Well, you can start with the development team you have.  They are already there,  and frankly, finding ways to keep the developers you have should be even more important t to you than hiring new developers.  What do you suppose you could do, to improve the velocity of the team you have, while also working to keep that team happy?

Continuous Improvement sounds like such aa good idea for your software product. So, why wouldn't you apply the same techniques to your development team?   And while you are at it, why don't you minimize some of the technical risks associated with your software?

But that's just crazy talk. How could you accomplish all that?

It's actually simpler than you think.  

The full stack developer (aka Rock Star) is essentially a unicorn these days.  No one can stay completely up to date on every aspect of your development stack.  Nor should they try to.  That's almost developer abuse right there, and that developer will be voted as "most likely to burn out" in very short order.  

So let's start simply.  Find all the really critical bits and pieces of your stack, and make a list.  You can even prioritize it if you like.  Now, start assigning those bits to developers.  Make sure that each critical piece has both a primary and a secondary developer assigned.  It would be best for the developers to self-organize this.  But make sure that no developer is primary on too many things, but also make sure that every developer is primary for something.

Now, task those developers assigned to those bits with staying absolutely on top of those topics. Read all the news.  Read all the forums.  Read all the StackOverflow questions and aanswers.  The primary and secondary should both be doing this.  Now, when that framework or library or gem has a critical bug, someone on your team will know.  When there is a new release, one or two of your developers will know, and will have been trying out the beta and release candidates, so they know what the problems are, and how to solve or work around them.

Make sure your developers have time to do this. Encourage them to participate, and to attend training or conferences related to their primary and/or secondary responsibilities.

After your team is comfortable, start mixing it up.  If one or more of these responsibilities is more annoying/difficult, make sure those duties get swapped around. If a developer volunteers for the onerous stuff, make sure they get a chance to at least be secondary on one of their real interests.

ENGAGE your team.  And they will flourish. And improve. And your product will flourish and improve along with them.

Make no mistake. If you allow your team the time, and the training $$ to improve, your entire team velocity will improve exponentially, while reducing churn, and NOT spending mega-bucks on consultants and rockstars.
