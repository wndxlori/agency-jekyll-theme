# Too bad, so sad, no Ruby Developers to be found

Honestly, I am tired of this.  Tired of the constant hounding by headhunters.  Tired of being pummelled with job ads for "Senior Ruby Developers".

Guess what people?  Demand is FAR outstripping supply of these kinds of developers.  You have a few choices here.

### Maybe your current market has Senior developers available who don't know Ruby?
    
Yes, you could change your software dev strategy.  Calgary, for example, is littered with .NET and Java developers.  Of course, those who want to deliver rapid iterations to the market might be, rightfully, leary of this strategy change.

2. Maybe you could hire an intermediate developer, aren't some of those available?
    - well, yes, there are.

Personally, I would always choose a really good developer, of whatever background, who is a good fit with your team, and who understands your goals, and then worry about getting them up to speed with Ruby and Rails (or whatever framework) later.
