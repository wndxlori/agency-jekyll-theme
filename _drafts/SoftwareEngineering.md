The Problem with CIT Education

Software "Engineering"

[Responsive Enterprise: Embracing the Hacker Way](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2685692)

I'm trying to work my head around all the issues with the gaping hole we are looking at, in trained software development professionals.  

There are a variety of ways for people to enter into the profession:

1. University degree
1. Technical school diploma
1. Bootcamp
1. Online programs
1. Teach yourself

These are often presented as options to choose from, depending on your learning style and budget. But that's only part of the story.

University education is both expensive and elitist. And it is elitist.  Don't argue, I attended University of Calgary, and got my Bachelors of Science degree, majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Applied Mathematics. There just aren't enough spots in universities for all the students who would like to attend.  The filter is either cost or stringent entry requirements (or both). All A's sometimes isn't even good enough to get a student into one of these programs.  The cost of attending a university is often beyond the reach of many.  Certainly in the US, but here in Canada, too.  Even with student loans (like I did), it can be an almost intolerable burden.  And many programs churn out graduates with nice shiny degrees, but no practical experience. I find it interesting there are businesses that will sometimes only hire people with university educations, and other businesses that will never hire people with degrees.  There's definitely something to be learned from this, but it's probably not what you think. Neither one of these opposing view points is completely wrong.  But I think they also don't always understand WHY they have made these choices. And that WHY is the interesting part.

Technical school diplomas (2 year programs) like those at colleges or techical institutes are the next producer of CIT graduates. Since these programs only take 2 years, and are generally lower in cost that university programs, they are within the reach of many more people. But they have limited space available, and so these programs can be as difficult to get into sometimes as the university one. These schools spend less time on theory, more on practical experience. Graduates of these programs are the solid backbone of the industry. As I mentioned, I have a university degree, not a technical diploma, but if I had to make a recommendation to one of my teenage nephews or niece right now about how to enter the profession, this would be my go-to.

Bootcamps. I'm really torn about bootcamps. They are trying really hard to fill a gap, but IMO they are leaving a great big hole in the

What we really need is something more like a trade certification. Let's look at an electrian. Apprenticeship for the electrician's trade is 4 years, with a minimum of 1500 hours of on the job training and 8 weeks of formal schooling for 3 years, and 1350 hours / 12 weeks in the fourth year.  Once completed, you become a journeyman, and can work unsupervised.  (Ahem...) An additional 3 years of work (over a 5 year period) is required before being allowed to write the exam to acquire a Master's certificate.  That certificate is REQUIRED before you can pull electrical permits. (Ahem...)

So, like 7 YEARS of practical experience is required before you can formally work "without a net".

So, when I read about "senior" developers with 5 years of experience talking about reaching the pinnacle of their career, and not knowing where to go from there... I laugh.  When I read about company "founders" of similar levels of experience, I cringe. Not because they can't actually produce a workable product (because they can). It's because of all the damage they are going to do along the way, as they learn about all the things they DON'T KNOW, in the school of hard knocks.

I'm not talking about these bogus industry-sponsored certifications-for-profit, either. I actually got my Java programmer certification, and quickly figured out what a complete joke that was.  Anyone could have bought one of those cert-exam handbooks, crammed for a week or two, and passed that exam.  Doesn't mean you could program your way out of a wet paper bag, though.
