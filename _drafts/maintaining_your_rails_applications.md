# The cost of maintaining your Rails application

I see two different groups of businesses out there right now with Rails applications needing maintenance. 

There's the business whose life-blood is their application. They have a development team working hard, adding new features, making the application scale to a growing customer base, and fixing important bugs.

Then there's a business with a bespoke Rails application, which was built to serve a need in your business.  It saves you and your staff time or aggravation. Or it provides a function that helps your business make more money.

Either way, you and your business need to understand these two economic basics about your application:

Your application features are your asset.
Your application code is a liability.

Building an application yourself, or hiring someone to do it is a lot like having a home or office built.  You don't stop paying for your asset once it is built.  You need to maintain that house or office, if you want it to retain it's value (at a minimum). Like a house, you will find that a light switch got placed behind a door, where no one can ever find it (UX issues).  Maybe that swell deadbolt isn't enough to keep your valuables safe, when someone can just break a window and help themselves (security vulnerabilities). Or maybe you didn't quite plan for how successful your business would be, and that new storefront can barely hold all your new customers (capacity/performance).  And then there's just the week in, week out grind and chores to keep things looking and operating properly, like cleaning that oven or changing that burnt out light bulb (refactoring/library updates).  

Typically, application maintenance runs 15%-20% of the original development costs.  So if you paid someone $200k-$500k to build it, you should be spending about $30-75k/yr to maintain it.

Being prepared for continued maintenance costs will prevent you from developing an app that quickly becomes obsolete - and ultimately a waste of money.
