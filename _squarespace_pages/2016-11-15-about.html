<h1 class="text-align-center">About Lori</h1>
<p><font color="#111111"><b>Founder of The WNDX Group</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#111111"><b></b></font>A software consultancy that specializes in Ruby on Rails, iOS/Mac Development, and Software Training.<br></p>
<p>Got my start in software straight out of school, a B.Sc. in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.ucalgary.com" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a>, working in the Calgary oil patch.  Since then, I've developed software for the health, finance, and entertainment industries, as well as products used by other software developers.</p>
<p>When I'm not developing applications, I enjoying speaking at meetups and conferences, both local and abroad.  I also enjoy teaching, and currently offer 2 Ruby on Rails based training workshops.</p>

<p>@wndxlori is more than packets in the ethernet. She is an awesome programmer who is funny on twitter. -- <em>@cjewel on <a href="https://twitter.com/cjewel/status/282244741507194881" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">Twitter</a></em></p>
<p>Lori is a top flight developer and architect. On the technical side she is one of the most seasoned people I has ever worked with. She has an enormously broad and deep technical background but is still tackles new technologies with enthusiasm. Lori is also a great person to work with because of her direct communication style and honesty. Perhaps most significantly, in an business where acting on the best possible ideas can be pivotal to the success of the product Lori is a great collaborator. Most of the ideas I had while working with Lori were improved after I discussed them with her and she was always open to criticism and improvements of her ideas. - <em><a href="#">Hal Henningsmoen on LinkedIn</a></em></p>

<p><font color="#111111"><b><a href="#"></a>Passions</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#111111"><b></b></font>I am passionate about software craftsmanship, and the application of continuous improvement to software, software developers, and software development teams.<br></p>
<p>I'm also a card-carrying member of <a href="http://www.devchix.com" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">DevChix</a>, and a teacher at <a href="#">RailsBridge</a>, and a mentor and instructor for <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code</a>.  Helping to make a career in software development into a more welcoming opportunity for all women is very, very important to me.</p>
<p>When I'm not working, you'll find me spending time with my husband and my dogs.<br></p>
