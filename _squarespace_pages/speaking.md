##[Core Data in Motion](http://nsscotland.com/speakers.html)




NSScotland Oct 19-20, 2013

Have you tried to use CoreData in RubyMotion, only to get lost in the quagmire of simplistic or confusing examples, DSL's and gems? Have you been asking yourself these questions: Do I have to use XCode to create a CoreData model?; How do relationships work in code work anyway?; How do I pre-load data into my CoreData store?; What is an NSFetchedResultsController, and why do I need one?

We'll delve into each of these questions, and review the surprisingly simple, elegant solutions that RubyMotion can provide.

 

###Consultants & Rockstars, Who needs 'em? - 


[Aloha Ruby Conf](http://aloharubyconf.com/index) Oct 8-9, 2012  Honolulu, HI
 
   

 


Sound familiar? The Rails ecosystem has grown in leaps and bounds, like the Java ecosystem did in its’ early days. So many languages, frameworks, plugins, engines, libraries and tools. So little time to deliver your new project.

It’s tempting to hire a rock star who knows absolutely everything to get your new project off the ground. You can also hire "consultants" to help fill in the holes in your team when taking your existing product to the next level. Or maybe just hire a whole bunch of people for cheap, and they’ll get the job done... But did you ever consider the untapped wealth of the team you already have?

In this session we’ll explore ways in which the average development team can explore, learn, teach, and grow, until the sum of members of the team is as great as any Consultant or Rockstar.



###Mobile Rage


[RailsConf](http://railsconf2012.com) - April 23-25, 2012  Austin, TX
 
   

 


Most of us have been there. That website you want to use, from your mobile device, that just refuses to cooperate. From the Flash-only, to the can't f**king log in, to the redirect-to-mobile-and-stay-there sites, there's more than enough websites out there to invoke Mobile Rage.

Although we all know that the best mobile development strategy is "mobile-first", we also all know how many sites and applications out there were designed and built by people who didn't imagine how fast mobile would take over.

Come learn about the common mistakes most people make for mobile, and some of the simple solutions you can use to help reduce Mobile Rage, without having to do a complete rewrite.



###Rails 3.1


[Confoo](http://confoo.ca/en) February 29th - March 2nd, 2012  Montreal, QC
 
   
 
**[Rails 3.1](http://www.slideshare.net/wndxlori/rails-31)**
 from 
**[Lori Olson](http://www.slideshare.net/wndxlori)**
 


Another new version of Rails. Delightful. And terrifying. What's changed this time? Fear Not!

We'll be reviewing the changes and additions to Rails 3.1, giving you a walk-through of what it all means (asset pipeline, what?), in the context of a brand new app, and an older app that will need to be upgraded.

 

###Maps & Maps and Scale & Scale


[jQuery Conference](http://events.jquery.org/2011/boston/) Oct 1-2, 2011  Boston
 
   
 
**[Maps and Scale](http://www.slideshare.net/wndxlori/maps-and-scale)**
 from 
**[Lori Olson](http://www.slideshare.net/wndxlori)**
 


Maps are easy, right? Right. Except... when they aren't.

What about when you need to mix multiple data types on your maps?

What about when the simple solutions (paging) to complex problems (too much data) don't cut it with your users?

What about when your scaling problems exceed the bounds of all the available solutions?



###Consultants & Rockstars, Who needs 'em


[Madison Ruby](http://madisonruby.org/)  Aug 18-20, 2011  Madison, WI

 from
