#WIMBY - Wells In My Back Yard


WIMBY was an idea I had, quite a few years ago, after reading about an incident w.r.t. an improperly abandoned well in the community of Calmar, AB (more on that later). At the time, I was working with oil & gas data every day (in the development of etriever.com and welltriever.com), and I was appalled at the idea people could have an abandoned well in their back yard, and not be aware of it.



###Map


The main view is a map view, of all the abandoned oil & gas wells in Canada.  If the wells are too close together, they are displayed as a cluster, with the number of wells in the cluster prominently displayed.

###List


All the wells currently displayed on the map can also be viewed as a list, with the UWI (Unique Well Identifier) and abandoned date.

###Search


There are several "interesting" locations listed, but you can search for any city or town, and it will appear in the list to be selected. Once selected, the map will zoom to this location.

Previously entered locations are saved, up to 5.
