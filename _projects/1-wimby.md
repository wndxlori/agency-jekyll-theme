description: WIMBY (Wells In My Back Yard) is an iPhone application, developed by WNDX to ensure that no one in Canada needs to have an abandoned well on their property, and not know it is there. This was a challenging project, giving us valuable experience in dealing with the huge dataset of over a quarter of million wells in Core Data, and displaying those same wells in a responsive manner with MapKit.
