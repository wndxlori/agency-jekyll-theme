                                        the WNDX GUI Toolkit, a set of cross-platform C libraries, used to create

                                        Windows, X-Windows (Sun Solaris, HP-UX, SGI Irix), and Macintosh.

                                        When Java came along, and kicked the crap out of the cross-platform
                                        business. If you can't beat'em, join'em. WNDX became a Java programming
                                        consultancy, specializing in early applets for the web, desktop applications,
                                        and finally enterprise web applications.

                                        Introduced to Ruby on Rails pre-1.0, we were so impressed with the boost
                                        in productivity it provided, that we immediately started our next project
                                        with Ruby on Rails, and continue to develop Rails application for appropriate
                                        business solutions today.

                                        developers on the teams with which we have worked, it was time to
                                        formalize some of that knowledge, and we created the Ruby on Rails
                                        for Real Developers series of workshops.

                                        Ruby the language was developed to make programmers happy. It made us
                                        very happy when RubyMotion was released, allowing us to develop iOS
                                        applications using Ruby, instead of Objective C.  The result... we
                                        started developing mobile applications, and our first
                                        book was written and self-published &dash;
