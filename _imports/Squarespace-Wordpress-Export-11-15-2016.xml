      <title>Static Tables in Code</title>
      <link>/blog/static-tables-in-code</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-preserve-html-node="true">While there are a lot of great gems and tools to help us with creating great looking user interfaces in code in RubyMotion, sometimes I still like to explore how to do stuff at the iOS API level without using all the magic.  Especially when just writing the code turns out to be pretty straightforward and elegant all on its own.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Creating a static table in code, to display some detail data in your application is one of these cases.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">For my specific example, I have 6 items of information about a well to display, and this data logically groups into 3 sections of 2 items in each section.  So, we'll set up the table view using sections like so:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">class WellDetailsController &lt; UITableViewController

  SECTIONS = %w(Name Status Location)

  def viewDidLoad
    super
    navigationItem.title = "Well Details"
  end

  def viewWillAppear(animated)
    navigationController.setNavigationBarHidden(false, animated:true)
  end

  def numberOfSectionsInTableView(tableView)
    SECTIONS.size
  end

  def tableView(tableView, numberOfRowsInSection:section)
    2
  end

  def tableView(tableView, titleForHeaderInSection:section)
    SECTIONS[section]
  end
</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">With this code, I have set up my 3 sections (Name, Status, and Location) as a constant array.  Then we implement the necessary methods of the table view (<code data-preserve-html-node="true">numberOfSectionsInTableView</code>, <code data-preserve-html-node="true">tableView:numberOfRowsInSection</code>, and <code data-preserve-html-node="true">tableView:titleForHeaderInSection</code>) to deal with these sections.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Next up, we need to fill the actual table cells with data:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">  CellID = self.class.name

  def tableView(tableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath)
    cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(CellID) || begin
      cell = UITableViewCell.alloc.initWithStyle(UITableViewCellStyleValue2,
                                                 reuseIdentifier:CellID)
    end
    cell.textLabel.text = @details[indexPath.section][indexPath.row][:label]
    cell.detailTextLabel.text = @details[indexPath.section][indexPath.row][:value]
    cell
  end

  def showDetailsForWell(well)
    @details = [
      [
        {label: 'UWI', value: well.uwi_display},
        {label: 'Well Name', value: well.well_name},
      ],
      [
        {label: 'Current', value: well.status},
        {label: 'Updated', value: well.status_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')},
      ],
      [
        {label: 'Latitude', value: well.latitude.stringValue},
        {label: 'Longitude', value: well.longitude.stringValue},
      ]
    ]
    tableView.reloadData
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Here, we set up the traditional <code data-preserve-html-node="true">tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath</code>.  In it, we pull the data for the cell textLabel and detailTextLabel out of our <code data-preserve-html-node="true">@details</code> data structure.  This data structure is an array of arrays.  More specifically, it is an array of sections, and each section array contains an array of rows.  Each row is a hash, with a label/value pair.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The @details data structure itself gets populated with new values (the labels don't change) when a well is selected in another view (from a list of wells, or a map of wells).  The <code data-preserve-html-node="true">showDetailsForWell</code> gets called, and then this view is displayed.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">That's all folks.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Certainly, it would be far simpler to code this up using <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion">Promotion</a>, assuming you already knew and used Promotion. But it wasn't necessary to add another gem to my project for this.  And I now understand exactly how sections and rows work in <code data-preserve-html-node="true">UITableViewController</code>, so it wasn't a total loss ;-)</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">If you liked this post, you may find the prerelease of my <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://book.coredatainmotion.com">Core Data in Motion</a> book of interest.  Certainly if you plan to use Core Data in your RubyMotion project it will save you many hours of head-scratching. Chapter 4 (Load Optimization) is now available. This will be the last chapter before the book goes up to full price, so get it now, and you will receive the last couple chapters (and maybe some bonus content) as they are completed, at a bargain price.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Can't mass-assign protected attributes for rake db:seed</title>
      <link>/blog/cant-mass-assign-protected-attributes-for-rak</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, when you are attempting to seed your database in the latest version of Rails now, you may get: <p /> <strong>$ rake db:seed </strong><br /><strong>rake aborted! </strong><br /><strong>Can't mass-assign protected attributes: blah, blah, blah </strong><p /> This, of course, is to save us from the dreaded mass assignment vulnerability. I don't want to turn off that protection in my app, but I do want to do a mass assignment when seeding. I eventually found a solution on the Ruby Forum: <p /> <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/1013085">http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/1013085</a> <p /> but it was out of date, and I got: <p /> <strong>$ rake db:seed </strong><br /><strong>rake aborted! </strong><br /><strong>Sanitizer is not a module </strong><p /> So, I dug into the Rails source, and figured out that the updated version of code that you will need to add to your seeds.rb file is now: <p /> <strong>module ActiveModel </strong><br /><strong>&nbsp; module MassAssignmentSecurity </strong><br /><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; class Sanitizer </strong><br /><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; def sanitize(attributes, authorizer) </strong><br /><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attributes </strong><br /><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; end </strong><br /><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; end </strong><br /><strong>&nbsp; end </strong><br /><strong>end </strong><p /> Hope this saves others a little of the time I spent when trying to figure this out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Fitbit and Fitbit Aria</title>
      <link>/blog/fitbit-and-fitbit-aria</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I got my Fitbit a few months ago. Ordered on the day that they announced the Fitbit Aria scale, which I pre-ordered at the same time. I decided to just use the Fitbit to track, without trying to make any big changes, until the Aria arrived. <p /> It is sort of funny. I mean, I knew I didn't get enough exercise, but the level of activity that I do get, compared to what I *should* be getting is sort of eye-opening. As far as my Fitbit is concerned, a Saturday trip out shopping at Chinook Mall is the *best activity ever*. WTF? <p /> So, 2 weeks ago (last Friday) my Aria scale finally arrived. I had a couple problems getting it set up with the Mac app, but the alternate "setup using browser" worked just fine. My husband also wanted to try, so I set up an additional user and invited him. First (small) challenge was that the Aria is reading my weight about 5 lbs up from where our old, manual scale was. Not a big problem (it's all just relative, right?), but since I'd already used the manual scale reading on the Fitbit site, it was like I'd instantly gained 5 lbs. :-p This also caused problems for the scale when attempting to identify the "new user" (my husband). It kept calling him "Guest". After he tweaked his initial weight up, it figured things out and we were both set. At this point, we also set up our weight targets and plan intensity. I'm using the "Kinda Hard", with an intermediate weight goal that I'd like to achieve by the end of summer. Assuming I get there, I'll set a new intermediate goal, and keep going. <p /> Now, I started tracking everything I ate in the Fitbit app, as well as "additional activities". While gardening doesn't seem to add up to a lot of steps, it can be a lot of work, so I made sure to track gardening as an activity. In the Fitbit app, your base metabolic rate + your activity (steps + other stuff) all adds up to the number of calories you are burning. It balances that against your weight loss target, and figures out your caloric allowance for the day. The more activities I do, the more calories I'm allowed to eat. If I am less active, then I get less calories... sorta simple, but very effective. <p /> As I go through the day, logging my calories, my activity levels are updated whenever the Fitbit is in sync range of it's little docking station. The caloric allowance adjusts up or down as I go. If I go over, I get an "oops, you'd better do some more activities". If I stay below the range, I can treat myself to an extra snack. <p /> That's about it. It's been 2 weeks, and I've lost 5 lbs. Some days are harder than others. If you are going to go out for restaurant meals, be prepared to skimp on other days or really boost your activity level to counteract all those calories. Restaurant portions are huge. On one occasion, after checking the calories on the Boston Pizza menu, I ordered a pasta dish with way more calories than I was allowed, but then only ate half, and took the rest home for another meal. For me, the real benefit here has been the give and take of activities and caloric balance. There is immediate feedback. On a couple days where I went over my caloric allowance, the scale the next morning reflected the weight gain. And on the days where I've been good, and stayed within the bounds, the next morning I see the weight loss. That consistent feedback loop is the make-or-break feature, as far as I am concerned. So far, I'd have to say I am pleased with my Fitbit and Fitbit Aria. I'll try and post regular updates as I go, or if anything changes.]]></content:encoded>

      <title>RubyMotion and CocoaPods</title>
      <link>/blog/rubymotion-and-cocoapods</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, before you go very far with the <a href="http://rubymotion.com" title="RubyMotion" target="_blank">RubyMotion</a>, you will probably run into the need for <a href="http://cocoapods.org/" target="_blank">Cocoapods</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HipByte/motion-cocoapods" target="_blank">motion-cocoapods</a>.&nbsp; I know that was the fact for me, when I stumbled across a link to <a href="https://github.com/foeken/CarenMotion">https://github.com/foeken/CarenMotion</a>, and wanted to see how it worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Ruby developer with a lot of different projects on my plate, it was perhaps inevitable that I would be slightly perplexed at this point.&nbsp; RubyMotion is self-contained, with it's own Ruby implementation.&nbsp; But motion-cocoapods and cocoapods itself are gems to install.&nbsp; So, under which Ruby (I have 6 different Ruby/versions installed via rvm) should these be installed?</p>
<p>Thinking I was being logical, I started with MacRuby.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">$ rvm use macruby</span><br /><span style="color: #0000ff;">Using /Users/lori/.rvm/gems/macruby-0.10</span><p /><span style="color: #0000ff;">lori@wndx ~</span><br /><span style="color: #0000ff;">$ gem list</span><p /><span style="color: #0000ff;">*** LOCAL GEMS ***</span><p /><br /><span style="color: #0000ff;">lori@wndx ~</span><br /><span style="color: #0000ff;">$ gem install cocoapods</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Building native extensions.&nbsp; This could take a while...<br />ERROR:&nbsp; Error installing cocoapods:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="color: #000000;">So much for that bright idea.&nbsp; Thinking that total n00bs wouldn't even have rvm installed, I figured I'd go for the next easiest ruby, the System ruby, because I don't use it for anything at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">$ rvm use system</span><br /><span style="color: #3366ff;">Now using system ruby.</span><p /><span style="color: #3366ff;">lori@wndx ~</span><br /><span style="color: #3366ff;">$ sudo gem install cocoapods</span><br /><span style="color: #3366ff;">Password:</span><br /><span style="color: #3366ff;">Fetching: xcodeproj-0.1.0.gem (100%)</span><br /><span style="color: #3366ff;">Building native extensions.&nbsp; This could take a while...</span><br /><span style="color: #3366ff;">Fetching: cocoapods-0.5.1.gem (100%)</span><br /><span style="color: #3366ff;">[!] If this is your first time install of CocoaPods, or if you are upgrading, first run: $ pod setup</span><br /><span style="color: #3366ff;">Successfully installed xcodeproj-0.1.0</span><br /><span style="color: #3366ff;">Successfully installed cocoapods-0.5.1</span><br /><span style="color: #3366ff;">2 gems installed</span><p /><span style="color: #3366ff;">lori@wndx ~</span><br /><span style="color: #3366ff;">$ pod setup</span><br /><span style="color: #3366ff;">Cloning spec repo `master' from `git://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">lori@wndx ~<br />$ sudo gem install motion-cocoapods<br />Fetching: motion-cocoapods-1.0.1.gem (100%)<br />Successfully installed motion-cocoapods-1.0.1<br />1 gem installed<br /></span></span></p>
<p>Yay.&nbsp; All nice and installed.&nbsp; And, testing by running rake on the CarenMotion app, I confirm it works just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, on to a test project of my own.&nbsp; I'll be re-implementing the sample project from the iOS Dev School class I took this weekend.&nbsp; This is a decidedly non-trivial example, so I'm really looking forward to it!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>RubyMotion - In the beginning</title>
      <link>/blog/rubymotion-in-the-beginning</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a Ruby developer or an iOS developer, you may have been hiding under a rock and missed the introduction of RubyMotion (<a href="http://rubymotion.com">http://rubymotion.com</a>) yesterday. Doubtful, but just in case... RubyMotion is a commercial product, based on MacRuby, which enables you to write iOS apps in Ruby! And if that wasn't enough, Laurent Sansonetti (@lrz of MacRuby fame) is the creator. <p /> So why am I suddenly so interested in iOS development? Well, it's not so sudden. I signed up for the iOS developer program as soon as it came out. Still haven't released a single app. I've worked on several toy apps, and some prototypes for work, but not to the point of wanting to inflict their mediocrity on others by pushing them to the app store. I just couldn't get *into* iOS development with Objective-C. It was painful and hard and testing was almost impossible. And there was always Ruby &amp; Rails, beaconing me back with beautiful, built-in testing, and clean, clear pleasant-to-read code. <p /> Testing. Really. I didn't actually realize, until I was doing some MacOS (not iOS) development, exactly how 'test infected' I had become. I mean, I've been a developer for 25 years, and I didn't start unit testing until my later Java days, so I certainly know that you can develop without testing. I have, however, become impatient with debuggers and the like. I *like* testing. And it was *so hard* to get anything resembling a decent test suite going on my Objective-C/XCode project, that I eventually gave up. That didn't make it any less distasteful, though. <p /> RubyMotion comes with testing built in. I downloaded the sample apps (<a href="https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples)">https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples)</a>, and here is one of them, with 'rake spec' just built right in and working. <p /> $ rake spec <br /> Build ./build/iPhoneSimulator-5.1-Development <br /> Compile ./app/timer_controller.rb <br /> Compile ./app/app_delegate.rb <br /> Compile /Library/RubyMotion/lib/motion/spec.rb <br /> Compile ./spec/main_spec.rb <br /> Create ./build/iPhoneSimulator-5.1-Development/Timer_spec.app <br /> Link ./build/iPhoneSimulator-5.1-Development/Timer_spec.app/Timer <br /> Create ./build/iPhoneSimulator-5.1-Development/Timer_spec.app/Info.plist <br /> Create ./build/iPhoneSimulator-5.1-Development/Timer_spec.app/PkgInfo <br /> Create ./build/iPhoneSimulator-5.1-Development/Timer_spec.dSYM <br /> Simulate ./build/iPhoneSimulator-5.1-Development/Timer_spec.app <br />Application 'Timer' <br /> - has one window <p /> 1 specifications (1 requirements), 0 failures, 0 errors <p /> Beautiful! And it's Ruby! <p /> Now, don't get me wrong. To write an iOS app, one still has to deal with the CocoaTouch API's. And gawd knows, they aren't the prettiest things in the world. But programming Cocoa in Ruby, with testing all built in, is a FAR more appealing prospect. I was already going to attend an iOS programming workshop this weekend, trying to reboot my interest in iOS development. Now, it looks like I'll be taking that class with Ruby-colored glasses on, and enjoying it so much more than I had imagined. <p /> Thanks again, Laurent!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Not so subtle sexism</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>You, person who told me to lighten up, saw one little thing. It didn't seem like a big deal, did it? One little line! One joke! One comment! But it's not just one thing to me: it's one of thousands that I've had to endure since I was old enough to be told that 'X is for boys!' It's probably not even the first thing I've had to deal with that day, unless you've gotten to me pretty early.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's the main problem with subtle discrimination. It leaves those that it affects the most powerless against it, quietly discouraging them. If they speak up, they're treated to eye rolls at the least, and at the worst, are called oppressors themselves. We're accused of not wanting equal rights, but of wanting tyranny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would just like the million little barbs to stop, and I would like to not be told to 'lighten up'.</p></blockquote>

<div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://therealkatie.net/blog/2012/mar/21/lighten-up/">therealkatie.net</a></div>
    <p>I'm posting this in reference to - <a href="http://storify.com/charlesarthur/oh-hai-sexism">http://storify.com/charlesarthur/oh-hai-sexism</a></p><p>And, despite their apology (<a href="http://gklst.tumblr.com/post/19734620901/geeklist-and-a-public-apology)">http://gklst.tumblr.com/post/19734620901/geeklist-and-a-public-apology)</a>, I did just ask GeekLi.st to cancel my account.</p><p>Why?  Because the apology is an attempt at misdirection, to avoid taking responsibility for their one truly indefensible action.  They not-so-subtly threatened her employment.  Not only is that not cool, but it's a statement on the way they think, and the way they will do business.  So, I want nothing more to do with Geekli.st.  Period.</p><p>If you agree, go ahead and cancel your account, too.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Weird script running problem on WinXP</title>
      <link>/blog/weird-script-running-problem-on-winxp</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm a Mac. Completely and totally. For almost 7 years now, and I never regret it for a moment. However, sometimes at work, I have to use Windows PC's. This is one of those weeks. The number of "I hate f**king Windows" has risen, dramatically. <p /> Today, it was a weird one. A Windows XP machine, on which we have run some old applications for almost 6 years now, suddenly doesn't want to run the app. <p /> There's a .BAT file. It invokes a .JS file (don't ask). And, the JS (ActiveScript?!?) runs a Java application. Simple, no? No. Today, the .JS file just pops open in Notepad. Argh. The good news, after Googling for a while, is that there is a relatively painless solution: <p /> <a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/230/1/Error-There-is-no-script-engine-for-file-extension-when-running-js-files.html">http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/230/1/Error-There-is-no-script-engine-f...</a> <p /> And, BTW, if you open and run a .REG file that you downloaded from the Internet, without looking at it first in a text editor... there is no help for you. Just sayin...]]></content:encoded>

Seems like an simple enough solution, and it solves the problems nicely, where Users don't have the admin password, and Admins can't log in to the app and see private data.</span></span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">The problems all came later, on the development side. Multiple developers just about ripped themselves bald trying to track down mysterious errors that seemed to prevent user authorization... You see, once someone has used the HTTP auth, it replaced the authlogic user in the session, and THERE'S NO WAY TO LOG OUT OF IT WITHOUT SHUTTING DOWN THE BROWSER. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span></span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=clear+http+authentication&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">http://www.google.ca/search?q=clear+http+authentication&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a</a></span></span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">So, quick &amp; dirty turned into hours lost, debugging non-existent issues. If you are going to use HTTP auth... well, don't.</span></span></p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This article isn't entirely accurate, but it is not far off. It is possible to "log out" of most modern browsers by following the standard and using a bit of Javascript to perform an invalid login in the background. The essential flow goes as follows:

1. The user clicks a "logout" button (or types in the logout url).

2. The rails controller sets the session login name (haven't figured out how to get rid of that, but it is now the only thing in our session) to a non-existant user then runs some Javascript that forces window.location = "/".

3. The rails controller for "/" notes that the authenticated name is not the same as the authenticated name found in request.headers['REMOTE_USER'] and responds with a 401 status.

4. The browser responds to the 401 by removing the authentication stuff for the realm (we hope - see below) and prompting the user for a new username/password.

5. The rails controller for "/" now sees a valid name and all is well.

There are, however, clear costs and benefits to using HTTP authentication over rails based authentication.


First the costs...

1. It's tricky and all the bits must be correct for it to work. I followed a number of instructions that described this and none of them seemed entirely correct. It took some time for me to get it right.

2. If you are using DIGEST authentication then you must match the nonce and opaque items of the WWW-Authenticate header (in your rails 401 response) with what your server (Apache in my case) would have sent. Otherwise Apache never matches the credentials and you just get the login over and over again. This also probably ties this portion of your rails app to your server. Switch from Apache to something else and almost certainly the opaque, and probably also the nonce, will need to change. My code reads it from the request header so in theory it should be portable, but I've never tried it on anything but Apache.

3. You must do the logout and relogin on "/". Doing it on any sub-path (e.g. "/mycontroller/mycommand") does not seem to authenticate anything "above" that point and results in multiple login prompts. I still don't entirely understand that one as my reading of the protocol seems to state that any path that matches the realm should authenticate for the entire realm.

4. The browser can still ignore it. I've had it working fine on Safari and Google Chrome, but haven't tested too many other browsers. It almost certainly will not work on older browsers, but our application is very much tied to HTML5 so that isn't an issue for us. (Will have to get it working on IE9 though.) It also does not like the Chrome plugin in IE8 as it seems to view the browser and the plugin as two separate browsers resulting in two logins and a logout which leaves IE8 logged in as one user and the plugin as another.


The costs are not insignificant, but if you can live with them there are also benefits...

1. It's (almost) stateless. You do have to store the current username somewhere in order to force the change necessary for the 401. We use a session variable to keep it on the server. You could do it in a cookie if you really wanted to, but it seems like a bad idea to rely too much on cookies for authentication.

2. You can use different authentication methods for different installations of your web application. In our app some installations use the Apache password file, others use the Apple LDAT authentication, while the developers use an anonymous method (so they can become any user, whether existing or not).

3. You can use different authentication methods for different portions of your web application. We use digest based passwords for the main application, no authentication for everything under /public and a few other things that we aren't concerned about protecting (has a nice performance benefit), and IP based authentication for some items used to communicate with other servers for which we do not want username/passwords but do want to restrict the machines.

4. And this is the big one for our application - it protects all paths in our web application, not just the Rails paths. This allows static content to be on another machine if so desired and allows portions of our system to be written a C Apache modules in order to obtain the maximum desired speed in certain areas. Not that I would want to write too much in C, but watching the stats on which urls are called the most and redoing the top few in C has a big performance benefit - in our case enough to allow for less expensive hardware in a number of our installs.


Having said all that I would suggest that you weight your needs against the pain of setting this up and the limitation of requiring fairly modern browsers. All in all I really do wish some form of a "forget-credentials" would be added to the HTTP authentication protocol.]]></wp:comment_content>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today seemed to be all about re-discovering stuff that I had done before... but so looooong ago.... <p /> So, how do I... update a single attribute, on multiple ActiveRecords? <br />I have a list of jobs. Jobs (multiple) can be selected. And then, you can "move" (change state) on these jobs. So, I wanted a controller action to update a single attribute, on multiple jobs. This seems to do the trick. <p /> <a href="http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/7495">http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/7495</a> <p /> And how do I do Basic HTTP authentication again? <p /> I have used Basic HTTP authentication before, but it was so long ago, that I had completely forgotten how to do it. Nice, simple example: <p /> <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails-2.1/rails-http-basic-authentication.htm">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails-2.1/rails-http-basic-authenticati...</a> <p /> And how about testing (spec'ing) that? <p /> Of course, if you are going to add Basic HTTP Authentication, it has to be tested, right? I've tested it before, but never with RSpec. Interesting that the first several Google'd links produced bad answers. But I persevered, and found one that worked: <p /> <a href="http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=11669">http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=11669</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3768718/rails-rspec-make-tests-to-pass-with-http-basic-authentication">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3768718/rails-rspec-make-tests-to-pass-wit...</a> &lt;--- correct]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Lots of meetings today, so this is the short version. <p /> Git tips <p /> For Mac users, this is a useful one. Getting git to ignore the .DS_Store files, everywhere, in one swell foop. <p /> <a href="http://antoniolorusso.com/2009/03/09/ignore-ds_store-forever-in-git/">http://antoniolorusso.com/2009/03/09/ignore-ds_store-forever-in-git/</a> <p /> Buttons with image/text <p /> This is one of my personal bandwagons. Usability is generally increased, quite a lot, when you combine text and images for your action items (links, buttons, submits, whatever), instead of using text alone or images/icons alone. It's surprisingly hard to get these kinds of action items to work/look good in HTML. The following link is useful, if you are mostly dealing with ajax actions. <a href="http://woork.blogspot.com/2008/06/beautiful-css-buttons-with-icon-set.html">http://woork.blogspot.com/2008/06/beautiful-css-buttons-with-icon-set.html</a> <p /> And remember Rails folks, there is very little functional difference between a button_to with :remote and a link_to with :remote in Rails 3, so you can replace your buttons with these lovely links if you want to.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: 16px;">jQuery ajax requests &amp; Firebug console logging</span><p /><div>Coordinating development with our "front-end" person, we ran into an interesting problem today. &nbsp;I really haven't developed an exclusively ajax app before, so the full range of front-end Javascript interactions was new to me. &nbsp;Ran into a problem, with jQuery and a response to a remote form submit. &nbsp;Specifically, on the error handler.</div><p /><div>Some strangeness I found when I looked for answer:</div><p /><div><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3620205/jquery-and-rails-3-ajaxfailure-callback">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3620205/jquery-and-rails-3-ajaxfailure-callback</a></div><p /><div>But, that wasn't it. &nbsp;The simple fact is, Firebug failed us, in 2 different ways (Mac &amp; Linux). &nbsp;It seems trying to dump the entire xhr contents on the error handler fails when you try to access xhr.channel. &nbsp;Fails silently and mysteriously on Linux, and fails in ways that sometime block the console log completely on the Mac. &nbsp;Frustrating. &nbsp;Note that your status will appear in xhr.status, and your errors in xhr.responseText, if your action response looks like:</div><p /><div>format.js &nbsp;{ render :json =&gt; @job.errors, :status =&gt; :unprocessable_entity }</div><p /><div>And your failure binding looks like:</div><p /><div>f.bind('ajax:failure', jobSavedFailure);</div><div>var jobSavedFailure = function(event, xhr, status, error) {...}</div><p /><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">Will_paginate with Rails 3</span></div><p /><div>Couple of things about using will_paginate with Rails 3. &nbsp;</div><p /><div>Remote pagination links (awesome):</div><p /><div><a href="http://www.tricksonrails.com/2010/04/rails3-and-will_paginate-doing-easy-remote-links-rails3-tricks-02/">http://www.tricksonrails.com/2010/04/rails3-and-will_paginate-doing-easy-remote-links-rails3-tricks-02/</a></div><p /><div>And, as long as you are using the rails3 branch, scopes should "just work" (Model.scope.paginate), and you won't have to go thru contortions like this link suggests:</div><p /><div><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2792119/will-paginate-with-named-scopes">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2792119/will-paginate-with-named-scopes</a></div><p /><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">Resizable table columns</span></div><p /><div>Of course, when I suggested limiting the number of columns in our table, due to width constraints, our project manager decided he wanted resizable columns instead. &nbsp;If you are using jQuery, I suggest this plugin:</div><p /><div><a href="http://www.2dconcept.com/jquery-grid-rails-plugin">http://www.2dconcept.com/jquery-grid-rails-plugin</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And, back to the Rails 3 app today.</p>
<p />
<div><span style="font-family: Lucida Sans Typewriter; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Adding custom attributes to to_json</span></span></div>
<p />
<div>When dealing with forms that are submitted remotely, sometimes you need to provide information that you wouldn't otherwise think that hard about. &nbsp;In this case, we are creating Jobs for Customers. &nbsp;When you create a Job, it's always for a Customer. &nbsp;We display the customer_name as an autocomplete field in the form, and have a hidden customer_id field that is updated when you make an autocomplete selection. &nbsp;Simple. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>But what about after the form submit? &nbsp;You get back a Job to display in your page, and you want that Customer Name field. &nbsp;Tough noogies, you only get Job attributes back from to_json. &nbsp;Or... do you?</div>
<p />
<div>This link pointed me in the correct direction:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.gregbenedict.com/2007/11/28/outputting-custom-model-attributes-with-to_json/">http://www.gregbenedict.com/2007/11/28/outputting-custom-model-attributes-with-to_json/</a></div>
<div>The meat of the stuff I needed was here:</div>
<div><a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Serialization/to_json">http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Serialization/to_json</a></div>
<p />
<div><span style="font-family: Lucida Sans Typewriter; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Fixing a bug in the rails3-jquery-autocomplete</span></span></div>
<p />
<div>This one was fun. &nbsp;Turns out the little Javascript file that comes with rails3-jquery-autocomplete has a bug in it. &nbsp;You can specify an id field to be updated, using "id-element" attribute, but it never gets updated, because the jQuery selector syntax was wrong. &nbsp;Took me a while to find that one. &nbsp;I forked, fixed, and issued a pull request, so hopefully this will get fixed sooner rather than later.</div>

<div>Lots of bad answers for this one. &nbsp;But the proper answer (for my particular case) is "after_initialize". &nbsp;See the comment by insane_dreamer on the supposedly "correct" answer to this question:</div>

<div><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1550688/how-do-i-create-a-default-value-for-attributes-in-rails-activerecords-model">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1550688/how-do-i-create-a-default-value-for-attributes-in-rails-activerecords-model</a></div>
<p />
<div><span style="font-family: Lucida Sans Typewriter; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">validates_associated</span></span></div>
<p />
<div>This turned into a real bear. &nbsp;Anyone care to comment on why&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>validates_associated :customer, :on =&gt; [:create, :save, :update]&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>doesn't work, but</div>
<p />
<div>validates_associated :customer</div>
<p />
<div>does? &nbsp;The validation never seemed to fail (on bad data) with the first one. &nbsp;Aren't they the same thing?</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Rails Problems &amp; solutions for Nov 22, 2010</title>
      <link>/blog/rails-problems-solutions-for-nov-22-2010</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><span style="font-size: 14px;">will-paginate, ajax, and Rails 2.1</span></div><p />First up. &nbsp;I was suddenly faced with the need to display a kind of master-detail kind of data. &nbsp;But only one "master" record needed to be visible at a time. &nbsp;Perfect, I thought, I can use will-paginate to flip thru the master records, with a :per_page =&gt; 1. &nbsp;But... this data is embedded in a page with reams of other data, and I don't want to re-display the whole thing, just to page thru my master records. &nbsp;Ok, that should be simple enough, I just need to make the will-paginate links :remote, and only update the div with my master-detail data.<p /><div>After searching for "will-paginate and ajax" and "will-paginate and remote", I eventually found:</div><p /><div><a href="http://weblog.redlinesoftware.com/2008/1/30/willpaginate-and-remote-links">http://weblog.redlinesoftware.com/2008/1/30/willpaginate-and-remote-links</a></div><p /><div>This is a great posting. &nbsp;Too bad it didn't work for me. &nbsp;But I persevered, and read down thru all the comments, and finally, at comment #23, I found my solution. &nbsp;This particular project is stuck back on Rails 2.1. &nbsp;The original posting was updated for Rails 2.3. &nbsp;But&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Kiran Achyutuni </span>kindly posted his, revised, solution for Rails 2.1. &nbsp;I plugged it in, and it worked.</div><p /><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">Mocking Associations</span></div><p /><div>In the course of writing specs for the above solution, I was trying to mock out the result of the WillPaginate.paginate call. &nbsp;Although associations are not directly related to paginate, paginate acts enough like an association that I followed a link to this posting, and it provided the hints I needed:</div><p /><div><a href="http://blog.elctech.com/2008/11/18/rspec-mocking-association-collections/">http://blog.elctech.com/2008/11/18/rspec-mocking-association-collections/</a></div><p /><div><span style="font-size: 14px;">Ajax radio buttons</span></div><p /><div>In addition to the "paging" of my master-detail data, I also discovered the need to filter the master records in two different ways. &nbsp;Since ajaxifying the paging links worked so well, I decided that would work with my 2 new radio buttons as well.</div><p /><div>Again, this is a Rails 2.1 app, so I'm sticking with the older conventions, and this page provided easy examples of what I wanted to do:</div><p /><div><a href="http://martijnlafeber.blogspot.com/2008/06/rails-radio-button-with-remote-function.html">http://martijnlafeber.blogspot.com/2008/06/rails-radio-button-with-remote-function.html</a></div><p /><div>Just remember that, in your new Rails 2.3 or 3.0 apps, you should always be using Unobtrusive JavaScript.</div><p /><div>That's it for today.</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A new plan for more frequent blogging</title>
      <link>/blog/a-new-plan-for-more-frequent-blogging</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been trying to figure out a way to start bloggin more often, but I want to make sure that the time/value reading of my blog stays high. Today, I came up with an idea, so I'm going to try it out. <p /> It's a simple idea. Almost every day that I am coding, I spend a certain amount of time Googling, to find stuff to make my job easier. I don't like reinventing the wheel. Most days, I find multiple different solutions to problems. So, I'm going to blog, briefly, about the problems that I'm trying to solve, and the solutions that I found. Occasionally, I may even go off on a rant about finding *bad* solutions. <p /> I hope that you find value in it. Let me know in the comments on my new posts.]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A new plan, five weeks in</title>
      <link>/blog/a-new-plan-five-weeks-in</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was five weeks ago that I started working out regularly.&nbsp; And keeping track of my caloric intake, using the SparkPeople iPhone app.&nbsp; Five weeks in, and I haven't missed a single workout.&nbsp; Had to juggle around a little, on busy weekends, but I'm proud of the fact that I didn't let myself slack off, just because I had a good excuse.</p>
<p>And I'm down 5 pounds.&nbsp; It was 6, then I went overboard down in Lethbridge at my parents place for my birthday.&nbsp; That's allowed, right?</p>
<p>What does all that translate to?&nbsp; Improved energy levels.&nbsp; In the evening, I no longer sit on my butt on the couch, because I'm completely exhausted.&nbsp; I actually start to feel like getting up and getting stuff done, like some of those home improvement projects that I've been ignoring.&nbsp; I also have noticed a bit of improvement in how my clothes fit. Looking forward to a major wardrobe overhaul.<p />Anyway, I won't bore you with weekly, or even monthly updates on my progress.&nbsp; I'll just keep you posted on days like today, when I'm feeling smug about finally getting my butt in gear AND sticking with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>WNDXcasts is launched</title>
      <link>/blog/wndxcasts-is-launched</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After taking the plunge with the inaugural <a href="http://unicornfree.com/prelaunch/">Year of Hustle Launch Class</a>, I've procrastinated long enough (my problem, not the class) with my own product launch, and am finally announcing the the official launch of <a href="http://www.wndxcasts.com" title="WNDXcasts">WNDXcasts</a> - Mobile Web Development for regular web creators.<p />So, what's this all about?&nbsp; After being a smart-phone owner throughout the initial phases of the landslide rush to mobile, I know exactly the kinds of problems people experience with visiting websites using their mobile phones.&nbsp; I see those problems personally just about every day.&nbsp; As a developer for many years, and a web developer more recently, I also know exactly what is involved in fixing most of those problems.&nbsp; Some of it is so drop-dead easy that most website/web application creators would be embarrassed to think that they could have improved their customers' experiences so quickly.&nbsp; Other issues just require a little more work, but it's still not that difficult.&nbsp; And, at last we have the problems where you really need to dig in, and rewrite.&nbsp; I aim to teach people how to do all that.<p />As you probably know, if you follow my blog, I'm not much of a writer.&nbsp; I try, but writing isn't really my thing.&nbsp; So, instead of writing about all this stuff, I'm creating screen-casts.&nbsp; Videos that you can sit down and watch, following along with real examples and real source code, and immediately apply to your own website or web application.<p />If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, go to my <a href="http://www.wndxcasts.com" title="WNDXcasts">WNDXcasts</a> website now, and sign up.&nbsp; Everyone who signs up early will get extra special discounts when the first of the screen-casts becomes available in October.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Cancelling Rogers iPad data plan</title>
      <link>/blog/cancelling-rogers-ipad-data-plan</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 40 minutes on hold with Rogers (WTF?), I spent a lot of the time attempting to find some way of winkling out the information I needed/wanted out of the email (links galore), and out of Roger's website.&nbsp; Dad probably didn't want that Rogers account, but now he's got one anyway.&nbsp; Lots of pissing around later, I discovered this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rogers.com/web/content/ipad-dataplans#iPadDataUsage" title="Rogers iPad Data Plan Usage" target="_blank">http://www.rogers.com/web/content/ipad-dataplans#iPadDataUsage</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="thickbox_hdr" style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Cancelling Your iPad Plan</strong></p>
<p class="thickbox_cnt">If you wish to cancel your plan, you must  complete the cancellation process or your credit card will continue to  be charged at the end of each 30-day cycle.  To complete the  cancellation process, select the <strong>Settings</strong> icon on your iPad home screen, then tap on <strong>Cellular Data</strong> tab, then tap on the <strong>View Account</strong> button.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll have to do that for my Mom when I'm down in Lethbridge this weekend, and I can dig that useless Rogers card out of her iPad box.&nbsp; We got Rogers iPad cards for Mom &amp; Dad to use on vacation, and set them all up using Dad's credit card, only to discover that Rogers 3G service is unavailable in Waterton, where they vacation every summer.&nbsp; I think I stole Dad's Rogers card back... now I have to find it, and put it in MY iPad, and then I can probably cancel his.</p>
<p>Grrrrrrr. Aaaaargh.</p>
<p>Oh, yah, if you are wondering, I got them 2 Telus cards to use in Waterton, and they worked great.&nbsp; Just cost a lot more, but I learned my lesson and put those cards/accounts on MY credit card.&nbsp; Should still be good to go for when they visit Victoria in September.&nbsp; I'll cancel those plans after they get back.</p>

      <title>Gas leak forces out families</title>
      <link>/blog/gas-leak-forces-out-families</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote><div><p>CALMAR, ALBERTA — Five new Calmar homes have to be removed to make room for a drilling rig to seal an abandoned natural gas well discovered in one family's backyard.</p><p>In what the Energy Resources Conservation Board called "a unique situation," two families have already moved and Imperial Oil has confirmed it may have to purchase three other adjacent modular homes in the community, 50 kilometres southwest of Edmonton.</p><p>Stacy Smith, whose backyard deck is a few metres from the wellhead, said many neighbours were unaware of the situation until they were called last week to a meeting by Imperial Oil.</p><p>She and her husband, Trevor, who moved into the Evergreen subdivision in October 2006, heard rumours two years ago after another leaking gas well was discovered on the grounds of a nearby elementary school.</p><p>"Initially, I had a hard time finding out what was going on," Smith said. "Our neighbour came to us in the fall of 2008 and told us either our house or the house next to us had a leaking well. We didn't really believe it."</p><p>Smith said she had noticed bubbles in a puddle in the back lane, but didn't link it to a leaking gas well. Neither did her neighbour, who has since sold her home to Imperial and moved.</p><p>"She was going to put her fire pit right there where the well was. It's rather shocking," Smith said</p><p>"They're offering us just slightly more than we paid when we moved in here. We've put at least double that into our property, but they aren't interested in paying us for the improvements. It's been incredibly stressful. I'm at the end of my rope. I am just so sick of it."</p><p>Nobody knows how the residential subdivision was approved for development without anyone noticing there was an abandoned wellhead in the middle of the project.</p><p>Town public works director Ed Melesko said when the land was reclaimed 50 years ago, the well was taken off the land title and no one checked any further.</p><p>But he said there's evidence the well was detected by someone when the subdivision was being constructed.</p><p>"Somebody knew it was there because somebody hit it and nobody bothered to tell anybody," Melesko said. "If nobody reports it to us, we never know about it. That subdivision got built."</p><p>The developer, Aztec Homes, went out of business, but the owner now operates another construction company in town that sells modular homes. He declined a request for an interview.</p><p>Residents said the home closest to the well is the only home without a basement.</p><p>"Most of the people who live in the area think somebody should have known and if nobody did, that's a bit of a problem," said resident Heather Bouzane.</p><p>Bouzane said she and her husband Joe had saved up to take their three young children on a holiday to their native Newfoundland this summer, but now it looks like they will be moving. "I'm actually quite glad to hear we're one of the houses to go," she said. "Now I don't have to deal with the noise and everything. I am glad we're being bought out and won't have to deal with this any further. It's been stressful. It's just a lot of hassle for something that should never have happened in the first place."</p><p>Imperial Oil has temporarily sealed the leak and erected a tin shed over the wellhead, but says it must bring a rig on-site to seal or "abandon" the well to current Energy Resources Conservation Board specifications.</p><p>Residents worry their property values will fall and wonder if there are more wells.</p><p>Imperial Oil is involved with three leaking wells in the area, but the other two are in open areas -- a schoolyard and a park. One has already been permanently sealed.</p><p>Imperial Oil spokeswoman Laura Bishop said the wells were drilled by Texaco in the 1950s, but Imperial assumed responsibility for their maintenance with its purchase of Texaco in 1989. She said that in the 1950s and 1960s, it was common practice to remove as much production casing from the wells as possible before sealing them. More than 1,000 metres of casing were removed from the Evergreen Crescent well, which means sweet gas is seeping from formations 250 to 350 metres below ground, she said.</p><p>To permanently seal the wells, Imperial Oil plans to remove the modular homes and bring in a service rig during in the summer of 2011 to install a new casing in the well, cement it in place and eventually to cut off the pipe two metres below ground.</p><p>The abandoned well will require a permanent setback, which means the area around the well will be converted to parkland, she said.</p><p>"Our primary focus is the health and safety of the residents and our employees and contractors," she said. "We also want to minimize any inconvenience to them while we're doing the work ... We're looking at different plans so they don't have to be home when the work is being done."</p><p>Bishop said preparatory work and drilling could take up to six weeks.</p><p>Residents of some of the homes that will remain are dreading the prospect of having a drilling rig in the middle of their town of 2,000.</p><p>"There's no way I would have bought a house in this area if I knew there was a wellhead here -- and on top of everything else, it's a leaking well," said Cyndi Olson, 50, a physician who is recovering from two open-heart surgeries. "I am fairly angry."</p><p>Olson said she was hoping to convalesce in a quiet neighbourhood in "a nice quiet little town."</p><p>"What am I going to do now? " she asked. "It will be pretty disturbing for me as far as my heart goes. It's a huge concern for me."</p><p>Her husband, Ralph, 51, said one of his biggest beefs is there has been no one to turn to for advice or help.</p><p>He said local and provincial politicians all passed the buck. "It was probably the most frustrating part to me," he said. "Nobody seems to care."</p><p>Mayor Kirk Popik said Calmar is a good community despite this "unfortunate event."</p><p>"I don't think this is the end of the town," he said. "These things happen. They are unfortunately very common, but when you get down to the human factor, it's a big event."</p><p>Both he and Melesko said the town has changed its practices to check development areas for abandoned oilpatch infrastructure.</p><p>The ERCB said it has been available for more than 10 years to municipal planning authorities and land developers to identify all oil and gas infrastructure in areas under consideration for development.</p><p>"It is very similar to the call-before-you-dig program, and is used commonly, particularly over the past years given Alberta's growth," ERCB spokesman Darin Barter said.</p><p><a href="http://www.edmontonjournal.com/leak+forces+families/3100066/story.html#" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://www.edmontonjournal.com/leak+forces+families/3100066/story.html/mailto:dhenton@thejournal.canwest.com">dhenton@thejournal.canwest.com</a></p><div>© Copyright (c) The Edmonton Journal</div></div></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.edmontonjournal.com/leak+forces+families/3100066/story.html">edmontonjournal.com</a></div>

      <title>May 25, 2001: Towel Day Honors Hitchhiker Author Adams | This Day In Tech</title>
      <link>/blog/may-25-2001-towel-day-honors-hitchhiker-autho-1</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote><div>
            <p><img title="Towel Day" src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/thisdayintech/2010/05/towel_f.jpg" height="467" alt="Towel Day" width="350" /></p>
<p><strong>2001: </strong> Two weeks after the death of Douglas Adams, author of <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>, fans get together and celebrate May 25 as “Towel Day” in his memory. The tradition continues each year since.</p>
<p><em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> is a novelization of a popular British radio series. The books started publishing in 1979. Author Douglas Adams became an icon of humorous geek literature, wrote four sequels to it and, tragically, died of a heart attack at age 49.</p>
<p>D. Clyde Williamson made the initial proposal May 14, 2001, in the <a href="http://www.systemtoolbox.com/bfarticle.php?content_id=46">“Binary Freedom” forum</a> at System Toolbox:</p>
<blockquote><p>Douglas Adams will be missed by his fans worldwide. So that all his fans everywhere can pay tribute to this genius, I propose  that two weeks after his passing (May 25, 2001) be marked as “Towel  Day”. All Douglas Adams fans are encouraged to carry a towel with them for the day.</p>
<p>Make sure that the towel is conspicuous — use it as a talking point  to encourage those who have never read the Hitchhiker’s Guide to go pick  up a copy. Wrap it around your head, use it as a weapon, soak it in  nutrients- whatever you want!</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://thegreatgeekmanual.com/blog/this-day-in-geek-history-may-25" target="blank">Towel Day</a> asks the important questions. For instance, if you learned that planet Earth was about to be destroyed to make room for an interstellar expressway, would you be prepared? It’s not about making peace with your God or clearing up all your debts; it’s about something much more important and useful. Do you have your towel?</p>
<p>And according to the <em>Guide</em>, you’d know if you did. It would be wrapped around your neck and you’d feel secure and prepared for whatever the galaxy were to throw at you. On Towel Day, you’d better have your towel, because you never know what’s coming, or going for that matter.</p>
<p>This year, as we do <a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/05/dont-panic-towe/" target="blank">every year</a>, we take a moment to hoist our thumbs up in the air and hope we don’t end up in the cargo hold of a Vogon warship. However, if we have our towel on us we’ll be perfectly prepared for whatever may come. Or go.</p>
<p>So why the towel? What’s so great about something seemingly so simple and basic? From Chapter 3 of <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can’t see it, it can’t see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.</p>
<p>More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some  reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have “lost”. What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it,  struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have a towel, you are not only ultimately prepared but others around you will become aware of  your ultimate preparedness and be randomly willing to assist to make sure you are even further prepared for your journey. Could you ask for anything more? This is what having a towel handy can do for you.</p>
<p>In honor of Douglas Adams: So long and thanks for all the fish!!</p>

From the press release:</p>
<p>“<i>Combined, the documentation and tools advance interoperability with data stored in .pst files, reflecting customer requests for greater access to data stored and shared in digital formats generated by Microsoft Outlook and for enhanced data portability</i>.”</p>
<p>The two open source projects, available on Copeplex under the Apache 2.0 license are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PST Data Structure View Tool (<a href="http://pstviewtool.codeplex.com/">http://pstviewtool.codeplex.com/</a>) is a graphical tool allowing the developers to browse the internal data structures of a PST file. The primary goal of this tool is to assist people who are learning .pst format and help them to better understand the documentation.</li>
<li>The PST File Format SDK (<a href="http://pstsdk.codeplex.com/">http://pstsdk.codeplex.com/</a>) is a cross platform C++ library for reading .pst files that can be incorporated into solutions that run on top of the .pst file format. The capability to write data to .pst files is part of the roadmap will be added to the SDK. </li></ul></blockquote>

I'm really happy that <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/05/21/apples-new-campaign-why-youll-love-a-mac/">Apple is once again talking about why people will love the Mac</a> when they finally escape from Windows. I had an experience over the last few days that reinforced my love affair with the Mac. Since many of you are also Mac fanatics, I thought you'd love to hear the step-by-step, agonizing situation I endured. <p>


All I wanted to do was install a Wi-Fi remote-controlled webcam. Nothing spectacular. I had looked at a number of webcams on Amazon.com before settling on a rather inexpensive Chinese-made device. According to the vendor, the camera was "Apple Mac and Windows compatible," so I ordered it. It arrived quickly, and a glance at the manual revealed that I would need to use Windows to set up the camera prior to using it with an "Apple Mac." Since I always keep a copy of Windows Vista Ultimate running under <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMWare Fusion</a> for such emergencies, I felt this would be a quick process. </p><p>

Yeah, right.</p><p>

Fortunately for you, I've documented the installation procedure for posterity. Now you can enjoy my own personal vision of Hell. It's called using Windows.</p><div><p>

1) Screw antenna into base of webcam at 6:55PM. This is going to be fun!<br />
2) Plug in power supply. Camera moves for a bit, then settles down.<br />
3) Fire up Windows, then realize that I can't use the camera software install CD since it's one of those mini ones that were so popular in 1998. They don't work in slot-type SuperDrives. Need to download the software from vendor's website.<br />
4) Start up IE7 in Windows.<br />
5) Can't get to downloads page from IE7 so download and install Firefox.<br />
6) Go to vendor site, get to the downloads page. Can't download the software until I download and install the Flash plug-in.<br />
7) Install Flash Player.<br />
8) Download the software, finally. It's an .rar archive.<br />
9) Windows has no idea what an rar file is. I have it "use the Web service to find the correct program." I find out that WinZip or StuffIt Expander will work. <br />
10) Realize that WinZip is a program that, with all the add-INS, will cost me almost US$37. Didn't it used to be free? <br />
11) Go to StuffIt site and download free StuffIt Expander. Wait while McAfee scans for viruses.<br />
12) Install StuffIt Expander. "This may take several minutes" it says.<br />
13) Installation continues for an incredibly long time, most of which is marked by a status message that doesn't change. Considering taking up smoking. Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_peace" target="_blank">War and Peace</a> cover to cover while waiting for installation to complete, then build a 1:1 scale model of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Sagrada_Familia" target="_blank">La Sagreda Familia</a> out of toothpicks. About to perform a self-appendectomy when the installation finally finishes. Put away the X-acto knife and vodka.<br />
14) Trying to reinstall StuffIt when Windows tells me in needs to activate. That's perplexing since I installed and activated this legal copy of Windows Vista Ultimate weeks ago. Decide to at least try reinstalling StuffIt before going through activation again. <br />
15) StuffIt Expander installer won't run since it says that there's already another installation in progress. System monitor shows no other application is running. <br />
16) Restart Windows. Or at least try to. It takes forever to shut down. Finally Force Quit VMWare and hope for the best.<br />
17) Re-launch VMWare, which unfortunately comes up in Windows shutdown mode. Finally find the Shut Down command in VMWare, then restart Windows Vista. It's now 7:55 PM. Windows Vista plays its 4-tone startup tune, which I salute with two raised middle fingers.<br />
18) Start up the StuffIt Expander installer again. Get an error message. Re-download the installer and try again, this time sacrificing a chicken while starting the installer. The installer takes its good time, but finally shows a completed installation. I feel sorry for the chicken, but happy that StuffIt Expander is installed.<br />
19) What was I doing before all of this? Oh, yeah - I was trying to unzip the webcam installer. This goes well until the unzip crashes. I see the installer on my desktop, so I double-click to install. This installer runs quickly, but I need to reboot the Windows virtual machine. <br />
20) Weeping uncontrollably, I wait as the virtual machine lies to me about shutting down. It's now 8:09 PM. I wait, and wait. Did I mention the waiting? <br />
21) I'm so bloody tired of waiting for the shutdown that I invoke the Shutdown menu item again. Windows reboots again.<br />
22) Double-click the webcam software. After I nearly have a heart attack when it temporarily can't find the .exe file, it launches. This program is supposed to find a camera on the network and allow me to change settings. It's doing nothing, so I decide to start pinging addresses on my network from Safari. I find my printer's built-in web server, but not the webcam.<br />
23) While I'm playing on the Mac, Windows mysteriously reboots itself. WTF?<br />
24) I figure out that Windows thinks it is on another subnet. I look at some of the glowing reviews on Amazon and see the key phrase "connect to the camera over Ethernet the first time." Nice of the vendor to put that in the docs. I'm tired. It's now 8:58 PM. I decide to try this tomorrow on my old iMac since I have work to do. I'll set up a small Ethernet network using a router I have, and hope that I can get this to work. <br />
<em><br />
*Time passes*</em></p><p>

25) It's now the next afternoon. I set up the old Linksys router, grab a few Ethernet cables, and fire up the camera app on the old iMac under VMWare and Win XP. Not surprisingly, Win XP works much better than Vista and within about 5 minutes I'm seeing the camera "anonymous" in the camera app. <br />
27) Reading the tiny print in the poorly-translated user manual for the webcam, I see that the vendor recommends using IE to bring up the built-in administrative web page and set up Wi-Fi. I double-click the name of the camera, and I'm immediately rewarded with a login screen for the admin web page. I log in using the default user ID and password, and then watch as IE7 proceeds to block the various controls that are trying to load. <br />
28) At this point I'm discouraged and shouting four and more-letter expletives at IE7. I decide that it's time to grab my spouse and go out to eat (and drink) away my frustration. A few beers later we're back home and I download Firefox onto the virtual Win machine.<br />
29) I launch Firefox, go to the IP address of the camera, and become very happy when the camera controller loads properly and responds to my commands. <br />
30) With the webcam finally up and running, I tell Windows XP to quit. Soon I'm greeted with a happy message that says something like "Windows is installing update 1 of 37. Do not shut down this machine." I wander off.<br />
31) <em>Two hours later</em>, the message says "Windows is installing update 31 of 37." I may never get to shut down Windows.<br />
32) Another hour passes. The message hasn't changed. I decide that Windows XP has locked up, and I invoke the magic VMWare virtual power switch. Who knows if the flippin' thing was updated or not?</p><p>

OK, a lot of this probably could have been avoided had I waited until Sunday, when I received an email from the Amazon vendor that I purchased the camera from. It included the magic words "If you have an Apple Mac, please give us a call and we'll walk you through the installation." I almost started banging my head on the table when I saw that phrase. </p><p>

But the point of this entire exercise was that if Apple had ever stooped to selling Wi-Fi webcams, the installation process would probably be like this:</p><p>

1) Plug your Apple iCam into a wall socket. <br />
2) Launch the iCam utility software on your Mac or Windows PC. It's included on the CD that came with your device.<br />
3) Your iCam appears in the "cameras on this network" list. Highlight the camera you wish to update.<br />
4) Give the camera a name, and click save. Note the web address that is now listed on the page -- this address is where you can point any web browser in the world to view your camera and listen to what's going on in streaming stereo audio.</p><p>

I'm sure I'll have some comments along the lines of "Well, if you had some familiarity with Windows, you'd realize that..." I <em>am </em>familiar with Windows. Way too familiar, as at one point in my career I was a project manager on a 12,000-seat Windows deployment for a large enterprise. Since that time, I've had my share of Windows experiences with my Mac consulting clients who have one Windows device on their network that ends up taking more support hours to keep up and running than the dozen or so Macs in the office.</p><p>

And I'm certain that someone will say "A real PC wouldn't have done that; you're running a virtual machine on a slow Mac." Wrong, this type of thing has happened to me many times on real PCs as well. This isn't a slow Mac; it's a quad-core i7 iMac running 64-bit Windows Vista Ultimate. </p><p>

To be perfectly fair, I think that Microsoft has done a much better job with Windows 7 than with any previous version. Of course, that's the same version of Windows that now looks surprisingly similar to Mac OS X, complete with a Dock at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>

      <title>CTV Calgary- Vampire bats and stroke treatment - CTV News</title>
      <link>/blog/ctv-calgary-vampire-bats-and-stroke-treatment</link>

<p>Vampire bats could hold the key to a new treatment for stroke patients. </p>

<p></p>

<p>A new study in Calgary will look at how bat saliva may offer up a way of breaking up a blood clot that is causing a stroke. </p>

<p></p>

<p>When a vampire bat bites a cow, it injects a protein that keeps the blood flowing instead of clotting. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The property contained in that bat saliva protein is now being used in a new clot-busting drug called Desmontaplaise. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The study is being done in several centres, including Calgary, and doctors plan to recruit stroke patients who were not able to get the current drug of choice – TPA. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Researchers are hoping to answer key questions like, "Does this drug open the artery faster, and more consistently, than TPA," says Dr. Michael Hill, a stroke specialist at the Foothills Hospital. </p>

<p></p>

<p>TPA is typically given intravenously within the first three hours of the onset of stroke symptoms. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The patients taking part in the new drug trial will be treated with Desmontapliaise up to nine hours after the onset of symptoms. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The main risk associated with stroke treatment drugs is uncontrolled bleeding and that is still a concern with the new drug. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Another concern researchers have is the reaction people may have to this new treatment. "TPA is a human molecule but [the new drug] is an animal molecule so one possibility is immune reaction,' says Dr Hill. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Despite the new drug trials, experts say it's still crucial that stroke patients get treatment as early as possible. </p>

<p></p>

Until now, iPad owners who tried the App Store -- to purchase tablet-designed magazines, newspapers, games and other mobile applications -- were greeted with a notice that Apple's App Store was not supported in their countries. Those uses could purchase the apps through their computers and transfer them to the device.</p><div>© Copyright (c) The Calgary Herald</div></div></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/iPad+Store+finally+live+Canada/3051312/story.html">calgaryherald.com</a></div>

This property is of type VEMapOptions and implements the following properties:</p> <ul> <li>EnableBirdseye: A Boolean property used to indicate whether Birdseye is available. If set to false the Birdseye map icon will be absent from the control.  </li><li>EnableDashboardLabels: A Boolean property used to indicate whether or not labels appear on the map when a user clicks the Aerial or Birdseye map style buttons on the map control dashboard.</li></ul> <p>The code below demonstrates how this parameter can be specified when defining a new map, note that no other parameters of the VEMap.LoadMap() method are specified, thus we should set their value to null, unless of course we wish to define the other properties.</p> <div style="border: 1px solid gray; padding: 4px; font-size: 8pt; margin: 20px 0px 10px; overflow: auto; cursor: text; line-height: 12pt; font-family: consolas,Courier New,courier,monospace; background-color: rgb(244, 244, 244);"><div class="CodeRay">

By the time she gets to Feb. 21, 1995 — the day she was fired by her employer of a decade — she is breaking down in tears and barely able to speak.</p><p></p><p>It isn't the first time she's had to share her personal story of pain before a judge and other participants in a cold Calgary hearing room.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it isn't even the second or third time.</p><p></p><p>Nearly two decades after she first filed a complaint against her former employer with the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission, Walsh found herself yet again Monday having to revisit those days.</p><p></p><p>A human rights complaint in Alberta — from first filing to final resolution — takes, on average, a little over a year. At 19 years, Walsh vs. Mobil has the dubious distinction of being the longest ongoing case in its 37-year history.</p><p></p><p>Since one morning in May 1991, when Walsh made the decision after "much soul searching" to file her initial complaint against her then-employer Canadian Superior, her life has been one revolving courtroom door after another.</p><p></p><p>She has since had to testify before no less than four judges at various levels and areas of the system; her daughter Angela has gone from her terrible twos to a 21-year-old university student.</p><p></p><p>Such is life when you choose to take on one of the biggest corporations on the planet.</p><p></p><p>Back in the early 1990s, Walsh was an ambitious young woman, excited at the chance to become the first female landsman — a job that includes among its duties negotiating contracts between landowners and oil companies — for Canadian Superior Oil.</p><p></p><p>First, she kept being passed over for promotion in favour of men despite her having the right credentials; then, when she was finally given a landsman job — but with lower pay than her male counterparts, not to mention having to contend with employment conditions that weren't applied to them.</p><p></p><p>She decided to do something about it.</p><p></p><p>"I just knew it was wrong," she said of the situation. "If people don't choose to stand up, nothing will ever change."</p><p></p><p>The real trouble started when she landed that dream position. Suddenly her bosses didn't think she was doing such a good job after all. Her supervisor told her he was going to "be in your face," and she was on the receiving end of dismal performance reviews.</p><p></p><p>When she was fired in February 1995, she was certain it was because she'd filed that first complaint not long after moving into the landsman position.</p><p></p><p>Life has been a winding road ever since.</p><p></p><p>In 2005, a series of decisions, dismissals and appeals had it looking like her struggle would never end: Commissioner Beth Bryant found Walsh's salary and job category were low compared to her male counterparts, but dismissed her second complaint, filed after her firing in 1995, that she suffered retaliation.</p><p></p><p>That decision was appealed to Court of Queen's Bench, which agreed with Walsh, ruling that she was entitled to compensation for loss of income and expenses resulting from discrimination. Lawyers for ExxonMobil, or Mobil Oil Canada — which inherited the case when it took over Canadian Superior a few years ago — appealed the decision to the Alberta Court of Appeal, which again found in Walsh's favour.</p><p></p><p>Now, the parties to the case are all back in court this week, speaking yet again before Bryant in a commission courtroom.</p><p></p><p>This time, the reason for the meeting is the issue of compensation, which now, for some reason, is back in the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission's hands.</p><p></p><p>On Monday, a small group of supporters — including her daughter Angela and her sister Debbie Cruikshank — joined Walsh.</p><p></p><p>"This has taken a heavy toll on her," said Cruikshank. "I think other women in the oilpatch should be thankful to her for fighting for their rights."</p><p></p><p>"She has been a real trooper," said Walsh's lawyer Stephen Hope. "She's carried on this fight, for all these years, mostly on her own."</p><p></p><p>As for Walsh, she isn't so sure that had she knew then what she knows now, she'd be up for facing another round on the witness stand.</p><p></p><p>"If you would have told me that 20 years later, I'd still be testifying, I would have thought 'no way,'" she said. "But there's no point in giving up now."</p><p></p><p>The hearing is expected to run until the end of the week.</p><div>© Copyright (c) The Calgary Herald</div></div></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.calgaryherald.com/life/Calgary+woman+still+struggling+through+year+complaint/3010878/story.html">calgaryherald.com</a></div>

      <title>How Dr. Seuss would prove the halting problem undecidable</title>
      <link>/blog/how-dr-seuss-would-prove-the-halting-problem-1</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <p> &nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="font-size: 28px;"><b>Scooping the Loop Snooper</b></div>
<div style="font-size: 14px;">an elementary proof of the undecidability of the halting problem</div>
<p>
Geoffrey K. Pullum, University of Edinburgh
</p></div>
<p>
No program can say what another will do. <br />
Now, I won’t just assert that, I’ll prove it to you:<br />
I will prove that although you might work til you drop,<br />
you can’t predict whether a program will stop.
</p>
<p>
Imagine we have a procedure called P<br />
that will snoop in the source code of programs to see<br />
there aren’t infinite loops that go round and around;<br />
and P prints the word “Fine!” if no looping is found.
</p>
<p>
You feed in your code, and the input it needs,<br />
and then P takes them both and it studies and reads<br />
and computes whether things will all end as they should<br />
(as opposed to going loopy the way that they could).
</p>
<p>
Well, the truth is that P cannot possibly be,<br />
because if you wrote it and gave it to me,<br />
I could use it to set up a logical bind<br />
that would shatter your reason and scramble your mind.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the trick I would use – and it’s simple to do.<br />
I’d define a procedure – we’ll name the thing Q -<br />
that would take any program and call P (of course!)<br />
to tell if it looped, by reading the source;
</p>
<p>
And if so, Q would simply print “Loop!” and then stop;<br />
but if no, Q would go right back to the top, <br />
and start off again, looping endlessly back,<br />
til the universe dies and is frozen and black.
</p>
<p>
And this program called Q wouldn’t stay on the shelf;<br />
I would run it, and (fiendishly) feed it <i>itself</i>.<br />
What behaviour results when I do this with Q?<br />
When it reads its own source, just what will it do?
</p>
<p>
If P warns of loops, Q will print “Loop!” and quit;<br />
yet P is supposed to speak truly of it.<br />
So if Q’s going to quit, then P should say, “Fine!” -<br />
which will make Q go back to its very first line!
</p>
<p>
No matter what P would have done, Q will scoop it:<br />
Q uses P’s output to make P look stupid.<br />
If P gets things right then it lies in its tooth;<br />
and if it speaks falsely, it’s telling the truth!
</p>
<p>
I’ve created a paradox, neat as can be -<br />
and simply by using your putative P.<br />
When you assumed P you stepped into a snare;<br />
Your assumptions have led you right into my lair.
</p>
<p>
So, how to escape from this logical mess?<br />
I don’t have to tell you; I’m sure you can guess.<br />
By <i>reductio</i>, there cannot possibly be<br />
a procedure that acts like the mythical P.
</p>
<p>
You can never discover mechanical means<br />
for predicting the acts of computing machines.<br />
It’s something that cannot be done. So we users<br />
must find our own bugs; our computers are losers!
</p>

      <title>Ada Lovelace Day #ALD10</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Ok, I forgot to "pledge" about my blog posting for Ada Lovelace Day, but I'll do it now anyway, because it's sad that so few people today know about Ada.</div><p /><div>Briefly, for those of you who just said "Ada who?", Ada Lovelace was the very first programmer. &nbsp;Yep, that's right, the first programmer was a <b>woman</b>. Charles Babbage's analytical engine, the very first computer, would have disappeared into obscurity, if not for this remarkable woman.</div><p /><div>From <a href="http://findingada.com">http://findingada.com</a></div><p /><div>"Ada had been taught mathematics from a very young age by her mother and&nbsp;met Babbage in 1833. Ten years&nbsp;later she translated Luigi Menabrea’s&nbsp;memoir on Babbage’s Analytical Engine, appending notes that included a&nbsp;method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the machine – the first&nbsp;computer programme. The calculations&nbsp;were never carried out, as the&nbsp;machine was never built. She also wrote the very first description of a&nbsp;computer&nbsp;and of software."</div><p /><div>Now, about the pledge. &nbsp;The purpose of the pledge is "to draw attention to the achievements of women in technology and science". &nbsp;A worthy goal.</div><p /><div>I'm going to talk about some of the resource groups for technical women. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><p /><div>DevChix. &nbsp;The brainchild of Desi McAdam (@desi on Twitter), I think the website says it best: &nbsp;We're an international group of female programmers working to make the tech community a better place for&nbsp;everyone.</div><p /><div><a href="http://www.devchix.com/">http://www.devchix.com/</a></div><p /><div>LinuxChix. &nbsp;LinuxChix is a community for women who like&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;and&nbsp;Free Software, and&nbsp;for women and men who want to&nbsp;support women in computing. The&nbsp;membership ranges from novices to experienced users, and includes&nbsp;professional and amateur programmers, system administrators and&nbsp;technical writers.</div><p /><div><a href="http://www.linuxchix.org/">http://www.linuxchix.org/</a></div><p /><div>Systers. &nbsp;Systers&nbsp;is the world’s&nbsp;largest email community of technical women in computing. It was founded&nbsp;by&nbsp;Anita&nbsp;Borg&nbsp;in&nbsp;1987 as a small electronic mailing list for women in&nbsp;“systems”. Today,&nbsp;Systers&nbsp;broadly&nbsp;promotes the interests of&nbsp;women in the computing and technology fields.</div><p /><div><a href="http://www.systers.org/mailman/listinfo/systers">http://www.systers.org/mailman/listinfo/systers</a></div><br /><div>I'm really only active on DevChix, but I've poked around in all of them. &nbsp;And this is just a teeny-tiny subset of the available groups. &nbsp;If none of these seems to fit exactly, then just jump into one of them and speak up and ask. &nbsp;Nice groups, all of them. &nbsp;No flames and lots of helpful answers. &nbsp;Sort of what I expect from <b>my</b>&nbsp;online communities. &nbsp;Technical women <b>know</b>&nbsp;community like few others.<p />Enjoy!</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Baen's Webscriptions turns ten - MobileRead Forums</title>
      <link>/blog/baens-webscriptions-turns-ten-mobileread-foru</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">I wasn't around in the beginning but it went something like this.<p />

In late 90s Jim Baen created a website for Baen Books. That was common enough. But then he did something unusual - he added "Baen's Bar", where real live authors and editors chatted with the Readers. Just that helped quite a lot to improve sales. But then Jim talked some authors into posting snippets of "work in progress" to the Bar to let people "bug check" and build up the buzz before the finished book came out. Soon enough people got hungry for more and proposed him to put up the complete books... for money. Thus the Webscriptions were born.<p />

According to <a href="http://www.baen.com/WS_FAQ.htm">Baen's FAQ</a> the service was to begin on September 9th, 1999 but was delayed two days.<p />

In the beginning only the complete bundle of books for a particular month were offered for $10 (in multiple formats and no DRM!). Later (at the readers' urging!) the bundle price was raised to $15 and the option of buying separate books was added. Afterward came Baen's Free Library and E-ARCs.<p />

David Drake <a href="http://david-drake.com/baen.html">remembers</a>:<br />
<div style="margin: 5px 20px 20px;">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Quote:</div>
	<table border="0" width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td class="alt2 vb_postbit" style="">
			
				[...]the traditional model of electronic publishing required that the works be encrypted. Jim thought that just made it hard for people to read books, the worst mistake a publisher could make. His e-texts were clear and in a variety of common formats.<br />
While e-publishing has been a costly waste of effort for others, Baen Books quickly began earning more from electronic sales than it did from Canada. By the time of Jim's death, the figure had risen to ten times that.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Many publishers only now discover that Jim knew ten years ago: DRM sells less than no DRM, free books help sell more books, and if you treat people as customers instead of as thieves, they pay back with loyalty and free promotion. I'm sure Baen's example will be one of the factors which will finally kill the Tower of eBabel and DRM in ebooks.<p />

      <title>Revenue Canada revokes New Hope institute's charity status</title>
      <link>/blog/revenue-canada-revokes-new-hope-institutes-ch</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote><div>
					

<p>The Canada Revenue Agency has revoked the charitable status of Calgary-based New Hope Ministries Institute.</p>
<p>The organization, which according to its website "strives to bring hope to the people of the world," was stripped of its charitable status on Tuesday following an audit of the 2005-2006 tax year.</p>
<p>That means New Hope can no longer issue donation receipts for income tax purposes and is no longer exempt from paying income tax (unless it becomes a non-profit organization).</p>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency alleges that New Hope "has operated for the non-charitable purpose of promoting a tax shelter arrangement and for the private benefit of the tax shelter promoters."</p>
<p>Its books weren't maintained properly, receipts were issued for transactions that don't qualify as gifts, and it undertook activities outside its corporate mandate, the agency alleges.</p>
<p>The institute issued receipts totaling more than $100 million for pharmaceuticals received through a tax shelter arrangement in 2005-2006, then immediately sent the pharmaceuticals to another charity also operating under a tax shelter, according to the agency.</p>
<p>"The charity's records, however, fail to substantiate that the values recorded on the receipts were accurate or that the property was distributed for charitable purposes," the revenue agency alleged in a news release.</p>
<p>"For its participation and tax-receipting abilities, the charity received a cash gift from another participating charity of $1.5 million. Of this amount, the charity paid $1 million to the tax shelter promoters as fundraising fees. The charity itself retained a meagre $500,000 from the total tax-receipted amount for use in its own activities."</p>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency is reviewing all tax shelter-related donation arrangements, with plans to audit every participating charity, promoter and investor.</p>
<p>New Hope Ministries Institute could not be reached for comment.</p>

      <title>"Mother of Judo" receives her gold 50 years on - Yahoo! News</title>
      <link>/blog/mother-of-judo-receives-her-gold-50-years-on</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote><div>
                <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) – 
The "Mother of Judo" waited 50 years to get the gold medal that was snatched from her in her first serious competition, a gender injustice that fuelled Rusty Kanokogi's winning crusade for women's judo in the <span>Olympics</span>.</p>
                <p>
The gruff, plain talking Kanokogi who has received praise and recognition from the government of <span>Japan</span>, the <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer;">International Judo Federation</span> and International Women's Hall of Fame, was denied the prize at a YMCA tournament for <span>being a woman</span>.</p>
                <p>
"This should never, never happen to a woman again in sports," Kanokogi said about the rage she felt back in 1959.</p>
                <p>
The 74-year-old was speaking in an interview with Reuters on the eve of last week's medal ceremony that rectified the wrong half a century later.</p>
                <p>
"It was a negative for a while but I turned it around into a positive. I started the manoeuvring for the recognition of women's judo and other sports. Basically it was encouragement.</p>
                <p>
"If the medal had not been taken away from me, who knows? Women's judo could still be waiting to get into the Olympics."</p>
                <p>
The gender-equality fighter who is now battling a rare form of cancer was born Rena Glickman and grew up tough on the streets of Brooklyn's <span>Coney Island</span> when girls were not allowed to play most school sports.</p>
                <p>
BOYS ONLY</p>
                <p>
"I was a strong girl, very physically active with no sports in school because that was for boys only," she said.</p>
                <p>
"So I took pleasure in hitting the heavy bag (punch bag) after school. I had a chip on my shoulder so I started using people in the street as a heavy bag.</p>
                <p>
"I was getting in trouble. Here I had the physical ability of a strong male with the mentality of a teenage girl. I was kind of lost. I was a lost soul with no place to go."</p>
                <p>
Kanokogi found herself in judo, intrigued after a friend showed her some moves.</p>
                <p>
She threw herself into the sport and practised with the young men at the local YMCA when asked by the coach to fill in for an injured boy in a competition at upstate <span>Utica, New York</span>.</p>
                <p>
Told to try and earn a draw in her match to help the team, the 24-year-old produced a surprise.</p>
                <p>
"Instinctively, once I took hold of my opponent's judo gee (uniform top) I just went in for the big attack and I threw him," she recalled. "It worked. I got a full point."</p>
                <p>
Kanokogi said that although it was not in the rules that competitors had to be male, she disguised herself anyway. "I wasn't told to take the ace (stretch) bandage and bind up my boobs," she said. "I did that on my own."</p>
                <p>
However, the tournament director confronted her afterwards, insisting girls could not compete and saying she would have to give her medal back or her team would be disqualified.</p>
                <p>
"I took the medal off and handed it to him," she said. "All of the guys wanted to give the medals back and the trophy and I refused to let them do that. We had a solemn ride back to the city."
</p><p>

NO SHRINKING
</p><p>

Kanokogi did not shrink from the episode.
</p><p>

Instead, she worked even harder as a competitor and instructor, travelling to <span>Japan</span> three years later to study the <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer;">Japanese martial art</span>. There she met future husband Ryohei Kanokogi, a coach for Japan's Olympic team.
</p><p>

She dedicated herself to the sport and the premise that women deserved the right to compete in judo at the <span>Olympics</span>, which men had done since in 1964.
</p><p>

Kanokogi, who married her judo soul-mate in 1965 in a partnership that produced two children, organized the first women's world championships in 1980 at <span>Madison Square Garden</span>, assembling 27 countries to satisfy an Olympic pre-requisite.
</p><p>

"In 1984 at the LA Olympics they once again rejected women's judo from the Games. I went crazy," she said.
</p><p>

Enlisting help from the <span>American Civil Liberties Union</span> and politicians, Kanokogi threatened legal action over sex discrimination and finally broke through when women's judo was staged as a <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer;">demonstration sport</span> at the 1988 Seoul Games.
</p><p>

Four years later it became a fully-fledged part of the Olympic programme in Barcelona.
</p><p>

"I wanted it not just for <span>United States women</span> but for women round the world to be able to be in the Olympics," said Kanokogi, who last year was awarded the <span>Order of the Rising Sun</span> from Japan, its highest honour for a foreigner.
</p><p>

"What the hell was the problem? It was mentality. <span>Full contact sport</span> for women. The first in Olympic history.
</p><p>

"Could the IOC relate to it? They could think of mommy on a horse but they couldn't think of mommy fighting."
</p><p>

Eileen O'Connor, head of the Brooklyn YMCA, presented Kanokogi a medal in "recognition for a lifetime of inspirational leadership and commitment to equality for women in sports."
</p><p>

The feisty Kanokogi is now fighting a battle for her health. She suffers from <span>multiple myeloma</span>, a cancer that has also led to kidney failure, forcing her on dialysis.
</p><p>

"Through the judo, my spirit is still extremely strong," she said. "I've lost some weight and I need a cane. However, I can use that cane like a Samurai sword. I'm not worried."
</p><p>

      <title>Your gadget does not exist... yet</title>
      <link>/blog/your-gadget-does-not-exist-yet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, it might exist.&nbsp; Just not at a price point that I want to pay.</p>
<p>I was trying to come up with items for my birthday wish list for hubby, and I was thinking new video cam.&nbsp; Not that my old camera is bad or anything (JVC GZ-MG505U), but ... there's <em><strong>new</strong></em> stuff that I <strong><em>want</em></strong>.</p>
<p>So, I started looking, and I came up with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flash based storage.&nbsp; Because my current camera has a 30 GB hard drive, and it still makes me nervous that it'll crash, and I'll lose everything</li>
<li>Optical zoom.&nbsp; At least 10X, but 20X if the camera has good built-in stabilization.&nbsp; Screw digital zoom, it's useless.&nbsp; I'll just turn it off, so better if it's not even there.</li>
<li>Still picture capable, minimum of 5 megapixels.&nbsp; Because it's nice to get pics sometimes, and they easier to share, too.</li>
<li>If it has extra removable storage, it has to be SD/SDHC or something like that.</li>
<li>Good stabilization.&nbsp; Because hand-held just isn't steady, and it takes too long to fix that crap in post-processing</li>
<li>Forward facing mic.&nbsp; Seriously... why do I see top/side mics on all these new vidcams?&nbsp; Not good for sound at all.</li>
<li>Full HD (1080p) resolution</li>
</ol>
<p>And, I want it all for about $500.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HA!!!!!! Yup, I looked.&nbsp; I can get almost all of that, but it'll set me back over $1300.&nbsp; Not likely.&nbsp; Guess I'll just have to go with the JVC for a little while longer.&nbsp; Sigh.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Don't sneeze...</title>
      <link>/blog/dont-sneeze</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I was having internet issues.&nbsp; Same as the day before.&nbsp; Day before was our server/firewall/everything box hanging.&nbsp; But this was looking like problems with the wifi.&nbsp; Anyway, I disabled the wifi for a while, and shut down Mail.app and kept working.</p>
<p>(Yes, contrary to popular belief, it is often possible to WORK without the internet.)</p>
<p>A while later, I restarted the wifi, and something wonderful happened.&nbsp; DNS started working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know, your going - huh?&nbsp; But the fact is, for about a year, my Macbook Pro has been stuck in IPv6 mode, and it always has to look for any internet address on IPv6, then fail/timeout, then look for it again.&nbsp; This REALLY slows things down.&nbsp; REALLY.&nbsp; Any web page that accesses images from one server, ads from another, and some social web content from another, has to time out on each of these different address lookups.&nbsp; Yah, that slow.&nbsp; You should see how slow on a Google Map with additional image layers slow.&nbsp; Slow, slow, slow.</p>
<p>I have discussed this problem with @phasorburn (because there has to be some benefits to a live-in sysadmin), but after an entire evening trying to figure out WTF was wrong, he gave up too.&nbsp; "Reinstall from scratch".&nbsp; Ack.&nbsp; Haven't done that since I switched to Mac over 5 years ago.&nbsp; I decided to wait for the Snow Leopard transition, and live with it.&nbsp; Hating it.&nbsp; Hate, hate, hate.</p>
<p>But, yesterday, magically, it "just started working".&nbsp; All my web requests are suddenly lightning fast again.&nbsp; Ok, they are just "normal", but to me, it seems like lightning fast.</p>
<p>Anyway, don't sneeze or anything.&nbsp; It might go back to being broken.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Agile. &nbsp;Sounds great, doesn't it? &nbsp;Do better work, and do it faster. &nbsp;Why wouldn't everyone do that?</p><p>I don't have any agile/scrum certifications. &nbsp;In fact, my only certification was "Java Programmer", and I got that before I figured out what a total scam all that certification biz actually is. &nbsp;But I was unit testing with JUnit in about 1998. &nbsp;Wrote way too many Ant builds. Did some pair programming. &nbsp; &nbsp;Twisted my brain writing Maven builds. &nbsp;Started using a continuous build server in 2003.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm just sayin… I've been exposed to a lot of agile practices, and participated in most, as they have been developed and evolved, over the years. &nbsp;And the one thing of which I am absolutely certain is that there is no silver bullet. &nbsp;No one practice that rules them all. &nbsp;No training, or process or methodology that you can universally apply to any and every team. &nbsp;I suspect the large volume of "failed" agile projects come from a notion that what worked at one company, or on one project, will automatically work everywhere else. &nbsp;That's just lazy thinking.</p><p>I guess there is one more thing I can practically guarantee. &nbsp;There is always room for improvement. That is one of the core values of agile. Continuous Improvement. No matter where you start, you can always find one way to improve your process, your team, your environment. &nbsp;And after you fix that one thing, then you find the next, and the next. Not all attempts to improve will succeed. But you shouldn't let that stop you from trying.</p><p>Need some help figuring out that first step? &nbsp;Or getting past a failed step? Give me a call. Always happy to help a development team take a step on the road of Continuous Improvement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Getting to know JRuby</title>
      <link>/blog/getting-to-know-jruby</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a former Java programmer (of over 8 yrs), it has been slightly embarrassing for me, as a current Ruby programmer (of over 7 yrs) to have never had an opportunity to use JRuby in a Ruby project.  I keep running into Charles Nutter at conferences, and saying "maybe next year" for far too long.</p><p>But last month, I finally got my chance.  New contract, new project, and JRuby seemed like the right choice.  Finally. Having run thru the JRuby book many moons ago,  to get brushed up with JRuby, I decided I'd haul out that "Deploying JRuby" book that I bought last year in one of my "hey, coupon!" book buying binges.</p><p>As I proceeded through the book, I discovered a problem that my coding partner had already discovered.  The example program, on which the entire book is based, no longer works, at all, because the gem version of the Twitter gem it was based upon was completely yanked by Twitter.  BTW, thanks, Twitter, for giving me yet another reason to prefer App.net.</p><p>Now, this might make things a little more difficult, but let's face it.  You aren't building a Twitter client, so using that example program is just a crutch, it's NOT necessary.  You probably have a project in mind already.  Fine, go create a jruby branch and get going.  Or you haven't started yet.  That's fine too.  You probably have a good idea of the kind of project, and which combination of gems you wanted to use.  So go find a nice example on Github, fork it, and get going.  That's what I did.  I grabbed the rails-bootstrap-device-cancan project, and started working.  I've learned a lot, too.  </p><p>In the coming days, I'll be posting again, reviewing my progress on the project I chose, and the problems I ran into, and show you the solutions I discovered.  It's been a lot of fun.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Core Data Load Optimization in RubyMotion</title>
      <link>/blog/core-data-load-optimization-in-rubymotion</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Updated July 13, 2015</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Today we'll be revisiting our previous topic, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/core-data-pre-loading-in-rubymotion">Core Data Pre-loading in Ruby Motion</a>.  If you've missed the earlier posts, you can find them here:</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/core-data-pre-loading-in-rubymotion">Core Data Pre-loading in RubyMotion</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">At the end of our pre-loading post, I mentioned that there was a problem with our load, when presented with a (much) larger dataset.  As it turns out, there are several issues.  Let's review these problems one at a time.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">First of all, we have the problematic JSON data load.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">    <code data-preserve-html-node="true"># Finds and opens the json file, from the resources dir, which
    # contains the data to be loaded
    path = NSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResource("Banks", ofType:"json")
    banks = BW::JSON.parse(NSData.dataWithContentsOfFile(path))</code>
</pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">As you can see, this code reads in the JSON file in one large gulp, then parses the whole thing into one big in-memory array.  With my much larger dataset (244,292 records), these two lines represent two places where my application will run out of memory. This clearly isn't going to work.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Second problem, the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">add_bank</code> method.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">  <code data-preserve-html-node="true">def add_bank
    # Yield a blank, newly created bank entity, then save the model.
    yield NSEntityDescription.insertNewObjectForEntityForName('FailedBankInfo',
                                                              inManagedObjectContext:@context),
          NSEntityDescription.insertNewObjectForEntityForName('FailedBankDetails',
                                                              inManagedObjectContext:@context)
    save
  end</code>
</pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In this earlier example, we simply add banks, one at a time, and each bank is saved to the database as it is added.  But add, save, add, save, add, save, etc, is not exactly the most efficient code.  For my 244k records, it REALLY, REALLY sucks.  We'll need to batch those saves.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I'll jump ahead here, and note that even when you batch all the saves, while running in the REPL, with the large data load, you'll still eventually run out of memory in the simulator while trying to run the load.  So that's challenge number three.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now that we have a grasp of everything that's wrong with the previous code, let's figure out how to fix it.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/55a02d1ce4b0da93269fdc54/1436560669435//img.png" alt=""/>
  

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Here is the whole solution, but we'll break it down as we go.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">  <code data-preserve-html-node="true">def self.load
    $stdout.sync = true

    # Finds and opens a CSV file, from the resources dir, which contains the data to be loaded
    path = NSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResource("abandoned_wells_20130513", ofType:"csv")
    loaded = 0
    FCSV.foreach( path, headers: true ) do |row|
      FailedBankStore.shared.create_bank do |info, details|
        info.name = row[3]
        info.city = row[5]
        info.state = 'AB'
        details.update_date = NSDate.dateWithNaturalLanguageString(row[6]) || NSDate.date
        details.close_date = NSDate.date
        details.zip = row[4].to_i
        info.details = details
      end
      # saves records to the store in batches of 100
      loaded += 1
      if ((loaded % 100) == 0)
        FailedBankStore.shared.save
        # prints progress for batches of 100, with marker '*' for 1000's
        print ((loaded % 1000) != 0) ? '.' : '*'
      end
    end
    # One more save, for the odd batch at the end
    FailedBankStore.shared.save
    puts "Loaded #{loaded} banks"
  end</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Starting with reading in the data file in a slightly ;-) more efficient manner this time.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">    <code data-preserve-html-node="true"># Finds and opens a CSV file, from the resources dir, which contains the data to be loaded
    path = NSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResource("abandoned_wells_20130513", ofType:"csv")
    loaded = 0
    FCSV.foreach( path, headers: true ) do |row|</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">My real-live dataset happens to be a CSV file this time, so we'll use the FasterCSV gem, and stream the file, reading in the rows as we go.  That solves problem number one quite handily.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Next up, how about we batch up those object saves to the database?  Still inside our CSV row loop:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">      <code data-preserve-html-node="true">FailedBankStore.shared.create_bank do |info, details|
        info.name = row[3]
        info.city = row[5]
        info.state = 'AB'
        details.update_date = NSDate.dateWithNaturalLanguageString(row[6]) || NSDate.date
        details.close_date = NSDate.date
        details.zip = row[4].to_i
        info.details = details
      end</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now we have a new <code data-preserve-html-node="true">create_bank</code> method, which differs in only one respect from the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">add_bank</code>, omitting the save.  And that <code data-preserve-html-node="true">create_bank</code> looks like:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">  <code data-preserve-html-node="true">def create_bank
    yield NSEntityDescription.insertNewObjectForEntityForName('FailedBankInfo',
                                                              inManagedObjectContext:@context),
          NSEntityDescription.insertNewObjectForEntityForName('FailedBankDetails',
                                                              inManagedObjectContext:@context)
  end</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Which is basically indentical to the old <code data-preserve-html-node="true">add_bank</code>, without the save.  Continuing in our CSV row loop we see:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">      <code data-preserve-html-node="true"># saves records to the store in batches of 100
      loaded += 1
      if ((loaded % 100) == 0)
        FailedBankStore.shared.save
        # prints progress for batches of 100, with marker '*' for 1000's
        print ((loaded % 1000) != 0) ? '.' : '*'
      end</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">After the new object is populated, we increment our load count.  Every time we hit an even 100, we save.  For the sake of the poor sucker running this load, we also print out a . for each 100, and a * for each 1000, so the progress of the load can be monitored. Yes, I added that, because I was the poor sucker that wanted a progress monitor.  This is an really handy idiom, and I wish more programs would use it.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I'll also point out that if you want to see those progress dots, don't neglect to add  <code data-preserve-html-node="true">$stdout.sync = true</code> (at the beginning, before the loop), otherwise your progress output will flush out in batches, which kind of defeats the purpose of doing it.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now, that we've reached the end of our CSV row loop we have:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">    <code data-preserve-html-node="true">FailedBankStore.shared.save
    puts "Loaded #{loaded} banks"</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Since we are unlikely to finish on an even 100 boundary, this <code data-preserve-html-node="true">save</code> takes care of the odd batch at the end, and prints out the actual number of records loaded, so we know that we got it all.  And that's it for batching our saves more efficiently.  So much for problem number two.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Last up is our third challenge, what do we do about running out of memory in the simulator?</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Turns out that Ray Wenderlich's Core Data tutorial was re-written with exactly this problem in mind. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/12170/core-data-tutorial-how-to-preloadimport-existing-data-updated">Core Data on iOS 5 Tutorial: How To Preload and Import Existing Data</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The solution is to not run in the iOS simulator.  <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://rubymotion.com">RubyMotion</a> can create OS X applications just as easily.  And the Core Data API's for iOS and OS X are identical in these cases.  You can just use the same models in an OS X app, and run this load with all the memory and power you need.  Simple, no?</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">We'll go ahead and create an OS X RubyMotion app:</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">motion create --template=osx FailedBankLoad</code></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I got lazy, and symlinked in the model files from the iOS app into this project, but you can copy them over if you like.  Just to make certain that the models are linked in to the app when it is compiled, I invoked the shared singleton store from the app_delegate here:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">  <code data-preserve-html-node="true">def applicationDidFinishLaunching(notification)
    buildMenu
    buildWindow
    FailedBankStore.shared
  end</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Then you can just compile and run your new OS X app with <code data-preserve-html-node="true">rake</code>, and when the REPL comes up, run the load method like so:</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">FailedBankStore.load</code></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">And sit back and watch the data load progress.  The OS X load application can be found here: <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://github.com/wndxlori/WNDXRubyMotion/tree/large-data-load/FailedBankLoad">FailedBankLoad</a>.  When the load completes, you should have a shiny new, stuffed full, SQLite database in a file called <code data-preserve-html-node="true">banks.sqlite</code> in your Documents directory.  You'll want to copy that back into the resources directory of your iOS appplication.  And that is a complete, huge data, pre-load for your iOS application.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I wouldn't want you to go away thinking we had finished, because we haven't.  We'll still need to display that data in the table view of our iOS application, and if you think that 244k records will "just work", well, you would be incorrect.  We really don't want to load up the whole dataset to do that.  So, in our next installment, we will be examining the use of <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsController</code> to manage our unwieldy dataset properly.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Until then…</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">If you found this post enlightening, you will find the ebook I wrote on these topics (and more) will allow you to spend more time working on your iOS application features, instead of fighting with Core Data for hours (or days).</p>

      <title>Core Data in Motion</title>
      <link>/blog/core-data-in-motion</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated June 5, 2015.</p>

<p>Recently I was starting a <a href="http://rubymotion.com">RubyMotion</a> project, mostly as a learning experience and discovered, right from the get-go, that I had a problem. My chosen project, to convert my WIMBY (Wells In My Back Yard) web app to a native application <em>seemed</em> like a straight-forward idea, but I had not taken into account some challenges.</p>

<p>Like the fact that 244k abandoned wells (just the abandoned ones, the entire dataset is over 750K) is a <em>very</em> large dataset for an iOS app. So large, in fact, that <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/ipad/#documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/cdProgrammingGuide.html">Core Data</a> was just about my only option.</p>

<p>After searching and reading, and reading and searching, I came to the following conclusions:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are lots of RubyMotion DSL's and gems for modelling data, but none really gave me all that I needed</li>
<li>I didn't really understand enough about Core Data to be confident about attempting changes/enhancements to said gems and DSL's.</li>
</ol>

<p>At that point I just decided to take inspiration from @kellabyte, suck it up, dig in and learn Core Data, and figure it out for myself.</p>

<p>It's been an interesting couple of months (this is a project I am doing on the side). I've learned a lot about Core Data, and I still have a few more things to figure out. But I have successfully:</p>

<ol>
<li>Created non-trivial Core Data models in code, with RubyMotion</li>
<li>Implemented relationships between models, in code</li>
<li>Pre-loaded my huge dataset</li>
<li>Learned multiple different techniques for optimization, so that I could efficiently display my wells on maps, and show them in lists</li>
</ol>

<p>I'll be posting about once a week on each of these topics and reviewing what I learned. I hope you will find it interesting.</p>

<p>If you, too, need to use Core Data with RubyMotion, you will find that the ebook I wrote on these topics (and more) will save you hours, if not days, of research and frustration. </p><iframe data-preserve-html-node="true" src="http://coredatainmotion.com/call-to-action.html" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="305" width="500" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></iframe>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Core Data Basics in RubyMotion</title>
      <link>/blog/core-data-basics-in-rubymotion</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated June 12, 2015.</p>

<p>I always approach posts like this one with a fear that it's "too basic" or "too easy" and no one will find value in it. Then I find myself looking for good solid introductory information on topics unfamiliar to me, and discover that good intro posts are hard to find. So here goes.</p>

<p>If you want to use Core Data in your RubyMotion project, then you should probably start with the <a href="https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples">RubyMotionSamples</a> project on Github. Although most of the samples are pretty basic, they all have valuable lessons to teach us. With the recent addition of OSX application support in RubyMotion, the samples have been subdivided into ios and osx subdirectories. The sample project you will want is under ios, and is called "Locations".</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="149.0"]<a href="http://rubymotion.com" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/5571d3cbe4b0d635f261b537/1433523148015//img.png" alt="RubyMotion Samples"/></a> RubyMotion Samples[/caption] 
  

<p>The user interface on Locations consists of a fairly basic <code>UITableViewController</code>, so we won't spend much time there. The interesting stuff is all found in the other 2 files. We have location.rb and locations_store.rb.</p>

<p>The Location model in <a href="https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/blob/master/ios/Locations/app/location.rb#L1"><code>location.rb</code></a> starts off by subclassing <code>NSManagedObject</code>. This is the basic model type of Core Data.</p>

<pre><code>class Location &lt; NSManagedObject
end</code></pre>

<p>Now if you were using Xcode, you'd be defining your models in a xcdatamodel file, using the fancy graphical designer. But we aren't using Xcode, so how is that done in code?</p>

<p>Fortunately, it's not that difficult. We simply need to create and populate an <a href="https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/blob/master/ios/Locations/app/location.rb#L5"><code>NSEntityDescription</code></a></p>

<pre><code>def self.entity
    @entity ||= begin
      entity = NSEntityDescription.alloc.init
      entity.name = 'Location'
      entity.managedObjectClassName = 'Location'
      entity.properties = 
        ['creation_date', NSDateAttributeType,
         'latitude', NSDoubleAttributeType,
         'longitude', NSDoubleAttributeType].each_slice(2).map do |name, type|
            property = NSAttributeDescription.alloc.init
            property.name = name
            property.attributeType = type
            property.optional = false
            property
          end          
      entity
    end
  end</code></pre>

<p>This code creates (and caches) the entity (which represents a database table), and adds properties (the table's columns) to it. Pretty simple. </p>

<p>I would suggest, if you are going to be writing code like this, that you invest in <a href="https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/blob/master/ios/Locations/app/location.rb#L5">Dash</a> sooner rather than later, because it will make answering questions like "What other <code>NSAttributeType</code>'s are available?" so much easier.</p>
  
      <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash"  target="_blank" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/5571d61de4b019f4b6c477b3/1433523742623//img.png" alt=""/></a>
  

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0321942051/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=0321942051&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=twg0f-20">iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</a> book describes the <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/mobile/9780132978767/28dot-model-view-controller-store/idp9443648">Model-View-Controller-Store</a> or MVCS pattern, which introduces the Store object. Turns out this is a really useful pattern when dealing with external sources of data, like Core Data, and that's what our Locations sample is doing with <a href="http://kapeli.com/dash"><code>locations_store.rb</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code>class LocationsStore
  def self.shared
    # Our store is a singleton object.
    Dispatch.once { @instance ||= new }
    @instance
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>Our store follows the Singleton pattern. In order to ensure that we only ever have one store object, the <a href="https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/blob/master/ios/Locations/app/locations_store.rb#L38"><code>initialize</code></a> method is declared private,</p>

<pre><code>private

  def initialize
    model = NSManagedObjectModel.alloc.init
    model.entities = [Location.entity]

    store = NSPersistentStoreCoordinator.alloc.initWithManagedObjectModel(model)
    store_url = NSURL.fileURLWithPath(File.join(NSHomeDirectory(), 'Documents', 'Locations.sqlite'))
    error_ptr = Pointer.new(:object)
    unless store.addPersistentStoreWithType(NSSQLiteStoreType, configuration:nil, URL:store_url, options:nil, error:error_ptr)
      raise "Can't add persistent SQLite store: #{error_ptr[5].description}"
    end

    context = NSManagedObjectContext.alloc.init
    context.persistentStoreCoordinator = store
    @context = context
  end</code></pre>

<p>There's a lot going on here, so let's take it one step at a time. First, we need to create our <code>NSManagedObjectModel</code> (MOM), and tell it about the entities we are going to be storing.</p>

<pre><code>model = NSManagedObjectModel.alloc.init
model.entities = [Location.entity]</code></pre>

<p>Next, we create an <code>NSPersistentStoreCoordinator</code> (PSC), initializing it with our MOM.</p>

<pre><code>store = NSPersistentStoreCoordinator.alloc.initWithManagedObjectModel(model)</code></pre>

<p>Then we define the location of our Core Data store, which in this case is a sqlite database.</p>

<pre><code>store_url = NSURL.fileURLWithPath(File.join(NSHomeDirectory(), 'Documents', 'Locations.sqlite'))</code></pre>

<p>Now we tell the PSC where to keep our locations.</p>

<pre><code>error_ptr = Pointer.new(:object)
unless store.addPersistentStoreWithType(NSSQLiteStoreType, configuration:nil, URL:store_url, options:nil, error:error_ptr)
  raise "Can't add persistent SQLite store: #{error_ptr[5].description}"
end</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, we create the <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code> (MOC), which we will be using to access our store as data is added, removed, and fetched.</p>

<pre><code>context = NSManagedObjectContext.alloc.init
context.persistentStoreCoordinator = store
@context = context</code></pre>

<p>I will point out here, that if you were programming this in Objective C, all the code from this initialize method would still need to be written, with the exception of about one line.</p>

<p>The code to add and remove Locations is fairly trivial, so I will leave it as an exercise to the reader. I do, however, want to help decipher one last bit of code. The <a href="https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/blob/master/ios/Locations/app/locations_store.rb#L11"><code>NSFetchRequest</code></a> which is used to pull data back out of our Core Data store.</p>

<pre><code>def locations
    @locations ||= begin
      # Fetch all locations from the model, sorting by the creation date.
      request = NSFetchRequest.alloc.init
      request.entity = NSEntityDescription.entityForName('Location', inManagedObjectContext:@context)
      request.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor.alloc.initWithKey('creation_date', ascending:false)] 

      error_ptr = Pointer.new(:object)
      data = @context.executeFetchRequest(request, error:error_ptr)
      if data == nil
        raise "Error when fetching data: #{error_ptr[5].description}"
      end
      data
    end
  end</code></pre>

<p>The <code>NSFetchRequest</code> is created, and we tell it what entity we are looking for by pulling it out of our MOC by name. Then we define the sort order of our query. Finally, we ask the context to execute the query, and it should return all our Locations, sorted by <code>creation_date</code>.</p>

<p>I hope this has demystified the basics of using Core Data in RubyMotion. It's not nearly as difficult as I had imagined when I started.</p>

<p>Next up, we discuss our first complication… How to define <a href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/core-data-relationships-in-rubymotion">multiple, related models</a>. Until then…</p>

<p>If you found this post interesting, you will find the ebook I wrote on these topics (and more) will save you hours, if not days, of research and frustration.</p>

      <title>Core Data Relationships in RubyMotion</title>
      <link>/blog/core-data-relationships-in-rubymotion</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
Updated June 12, 2015  
</p>

<p>So, we've been talking about using Core Data in RubyMotion.  If you missed my earlier posts, you can find them here:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/core-data-in-motion">Introduction to Core Data in Motion</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/core-data-basics-in-rubymotion">Core Data Basics in RubyMotion</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Today, let's dig into a more meaty problem.  Relationships between entities in Core Data.  If you google for that, you will undoubtedly end up at Ray Wenderlich's site, and his <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/934/core-data-tutorial-for-ios-getting-started">Core Data Tutorial fo iOS: Getting Started</a>.  Which, BTW, is an awesome tutorial that describes exactly how to set up relationships between entities in Core Data… in the Visual Model editor in Xcode.</p>

<p>Right, but we aren't using Xcode (you can, but it's probably not worth the extra effort of duplicating all your data models in Obj-C).  We are using RubyMotion, and we want to define our models <em>in code</em>.  Thankfully, it's not as difficult as it might seem at first blush.  Since I was inspired (and informed), by Ray's tutorial, I have created a RubyMotion project to illustrate this based on his "Failed Banks" example.  You can find my project <a href="https://github.com/wndxlori/WNDXRubyMotion/tree/master/FailedBankCD">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/core-data-basics-in-rubymotion">basics</a> post we already created Core Data managed objects, defined their attributes, and dealt with the persistent store coordinator, managed object context, and the managed object model.  So let's just assume you have all that, and get right down to… two models, how to connect them together.</p>

<p>I was interested to discover that a relationship is simply another property, much like an entity attribute.  So, when the entities properties are assigned, you just add the relationships to that array along with the attributes.  Seems simple enough.</p>

<p><img src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/001/384/Atrapitis.gif" alt="It's a trap" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, it's not that simple after all.  In order for two Core Data entities to be connected, each needs to have a relationship defined to the other.  The problem here being the old chicken-and-egg.  When you define the first entity, the second does not exist, and so the <code>NSRelationshipDescription</code> cannot be fully specified.  Argh.</p>

<p>But here's the trick.  You CAN create an entity, and add it to the managed object model, WITHOUT specifying any properties (attributes OR relationships) on it. Then we have a nice handy store of all the entities, pre-defined, and can proceed to lazily specify the relationships.  Let's see what that looks like.</p>

<p>First, I have re-factored my <a href="https://github.com/wndxlori/WNDXRubyMotion/blob/master/FailedBankCD/app/models/failed_bank_info.rb">models</a>, so that the entity creation does not add attributes at the same time.</p>

<pre><code>  def self.entity
    @entity ||= begin
      # Create the entity for our managed object class
      entity = NSEntityDescription.alloc.init
      entity.name = name
      entity.managedObjectClassName = name
      entity
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see here, this code is looking pretty non-specific to the model, and can easily be factored out.  In fact, that's where most of the RubyMotion specific modelling gems that support Core Data start.  I'll leave that as an exercise for you.</p>

<p>Next we have separate definitions for the attributes:</p>

<pre><code>
  def self.attributes
    @attributes ||= [
      {:name =&gt; 'name', :type =&gt; NSStringAttributeType, :default =&gt; nil, :optional =&gt; false},
      {:name =&gt; 'city', :type =&gt; NSStringAttributeType, :default =&gt; nil, :optional =&gt; false},
      {:name =&gt; 'state', :type =&gt; NSStringAttributeType, :default =&gt; nil, :optional =&gt; false},
    ]
  end
</code></pre>

<p>and the relationships:</p>

<pre><code>  def self.relationships
    @relationships ||= [
      {
        :name =&gt; 'details', 
        :destination =&gt; 'FailedBankDetails', 
        :inverse =&gt; 'info', 
        :optional =&gt; true, :transient =&gt; false, :indexed =&gt; false, :ordered =&gt; true, 
        :min =&gt; 1, :max =&gt; 1, :del =&gt; NSCascadeDeleteRule
      },
    ]
  end
</code></pre>

<p>We have similar atrributes and relationship defined on the <a href="https://github.com/wndxlori/WNDXRubyMotion/blob/master/FailedBankCD/app/models/failed_bank_details.rb">FailedBankDetails</a> entity, which is the inverse of this relationship.</p>

<p>Ok, now that we have entities, attributes, and relationships specified, let's jump over to our <a href="https://github.com/wndxlori/WNDXRubyMotion/blob/master/FailedBankCD/app/models/failed_bank_store.rb">store</a> object, where we create the <code>NSManagedObjectModel</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    model ||= NSManagedObjectModel.alloc.init.tap do |m|
      m.entities = [FailedBankInfo, FailedBankDetails].collect {|c| c.entity}
      m.entities.each {|entity| set_entity_properties(entity,m)}
    end
</code></pre>

<p>Here we have added all the entities in our data model (all two of them) to the MOM.  Once those entities exist, they can be used to complete the creation of the relationships.</p>

<pre><code>  def set_entity_properties(entity, model)
    # set up attributes
    managed_object_class = Object.const_get(entity.managedObjectClassName)
    entities = model.entitiesByName

    attributes = managed_object_class.attributes.collect do |attr|
      property = NSAttributeDescription.alloc.init
      property.name = attr[:name]
      property.attributeType = attr[:type]
      property.defaultValue = attr[:default]
      property.optional = attr[:optional]
      property
    end
    # set up relationships
    relationships = managed_object_class.relationships.map do |rel|
      relation = NSRelationshipDescription.alloc.init
      relation.name = rel[:name]
      relation.destinationEntity = entities[rel[:destination]]
      relation.inverseRelationship = entities[rel[:inverse]]
      relation.optional = rel[:optional] || false
      relation.transient = rel[:transient] || false
      relation.indexed = rel[:indexed] || false
      relation.ordered = rel[:ordered] || false
      relation.minCount = rel[:min] || 1
      relation.maxCount = rel[:max] || 1 # NSIntegerMax
      relation.deleteRule = rel[:del] || NSNullifyDeleteRule # NSNoActionDeleteRule NSNullifyDeleteRule NSCascadeDeleteRule
      relation
    end
    # assign properties
    entity.properties = attributes + relationships
  end
</code></pre>

<p>And voila!  We have a fully specified data model, with relationships and inverse relationships.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.englize.com/wp-content/uploads/Voila_Logo.jpg" alt="Voila!" width="75%" /></p>

<p>The complete <a href="https://github.com/wndxlori/WNDXRubyMotion/tree/master/FailedBankCD">example</a> can be downloaded and run. It's not actually that exciting without any data loaded.  I'm sure you won't be too surprised to discover that is the next topic that we will be covering.</p>

<p>Until then…</p>

<p>If you found this post enlightening, you will find the ebook I wrote on these topics (and more) will save you hours, if not days, of research and frustration.</p>

      <title>A Schedule that Fits... ME</title>
      <link>/blog/a-schedule-that-fits-me</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Random Thoughts on Developing a Schedule that Fits</p>

<p>It's been a while since I have been "under employed".  This time, it is deliberate. When I ended my last contract, I chose to not pursue new opportunities right away, because</p>

<ol>
<li>It's the middle of summer!</li>
<li>I have numerous personal/business projects that have not had enough care and feeding</li>
</ol>

<p>While on this kick, working exclusively for myself, I have gotten back to a schedule that fits my life.  I intend to keep it that way.  These are the keys to my new and improved schedule, that fits ME.</p>

<p>I'm not a morning person, and never will be. Don't get me wrong, I always knew this.  But I keep reading all these so-called life-hacks, where they tell me that I need to ignore my email, and the "little stuff", and get to work on my important projects FIRST THING in the morning.  Hogwash.  My brain doesn't fire on all cylinders first thing in the morning.  I use my mornings to catch up on the Inbox (not deal with it all, just get rid of the fluff, and flag the stuff that needs actual work for later).  And I catch up on Twitter/Facebook.  And I drink my coffee.  I eat my breakfast (thanks to Lift app I'm on a 21 day streak there). I open my snail-mail. I do most of this from my iPad, and the location varies. If it's nice out, I can sit out on the patio. If not, it's the comfy couch.</p>

<p>Once I'm done all that, I go to my desk and my computer.  Clutter takes away from my focus, so I deal with the bills and things (like the opened mail). Flip quickly thru my flagged email to see if anything urgent needs to get done today.  Open up Things (task management app) and review my task list for Today.  I'm getting really good at recognizing "Whoa, too many things", and brutally cutting/de-prioritizing.  Review my 30x500 weekly action sheet, and make sure I am making the progress I want to make (adding stuff to Things as needed) on my personal projects.</p>

<p>Depending on what time it is (still morning, maybe not), I'll start tackling annoying stuff on my Things list, stuff that I know needs doing today, and will only take 10-30 minutes to finish.  I think of it as "clearing the decks".  Because, when lunch rolls around, I want to be in a position to be finished what I've started.</p>

<p>I've also started working out again.  It's been almost 8 months since I worked out regularly.  Just before lunch has been a good time for me to hang that habit.  Also, if I don't do it then, I have another window of opportunity at the end of my work day, before supper.  If I was just doing it before supper, I know I'd get busy, "in the groove", and fail to stop in time to work out.  Having 2 windows makes it that much easier to get it done.  I'm also tracking that habit in Lift app. It's been a 10 days of regular workouts, with no "oops, I missed".  And it feels great. (And I've almost caught up on my Ruby Tapas videos!)</p>

<p>Ok, now it's afternoon, I've cleared the decks, worked out, eaten lunch. I am FULL of energy. Yes, the afternoon is MY prime time. That's when I can tackle the meaty hard tasks that require intense thinking. And the important stuff that I know is just going to take hours. Because I have hours and hours of uninterrupted time. And I get shit done. Lots of it. Because I have the focus and the time. If I am on a roll, I can just keep working as long as I want. Generally speaking, that isn't all night.  Or even all evening. Eventually I'll get tired, or hungry, and start losing focus.  That's when it's time to quit. Sometimes, my dog tells me it's time to quit.  He's surprisingly good at that. </p>

<p>If I have encountered problems or blockers in my afternoon of work, I'll spend time in the evening surfing and researching on my iPad, looking for answers. I can do that while tired, sitting on the comfy couch. Trying to continue working/focusing while tired has generally been a recipe for frustration, so I resist doing it.</p>

<p>So there you have it.  A schedule that fits ME.  I think that in order to develop a schedule that fits YOU, you need some time free of outside influence.  Those pressures that tell you when you "should" be doing your work, and when you "should" be reading your email.  And, of course, you need to have a pile of work that needs to get done, so you don't just fritter the time away.  </p>

<p>It's been an interesting 3 weeks.  One more to go, then I'll probably need to get back to a new contract (or two or three).  This time, though, now that I have a schedule that really fits, I will be resistant to the pressures to conform to other's schedules, and stick to the one where I am most productive and happy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>And the survey says...</title>
      <link>/blog/and-the-survey-says</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to everyone who participated in my <a href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/rubyrails-workshops">Ruby Workshop survey</a>.  Although I didn't get a tonne of responses, the ones I did get formed some distinct patterns, so I got what I needed.</p>

<p>In general, you prefer weekends or don't care, so weekend it is.</p>

<p>You distinctly prefer November, with a secondary preference of January, so we'll schedule it that way.</p>

<p>No preferences emerged for location, so I'll just see what's available/comfortable/cheap. ;-) (One write in for Dubai/Muscat… sorry, but probably not)</p>

<p>You really don't like "Mostly lecture", and lean strongly toward a mix of lecture and interactive work-along (which is what we've always done, good to know).</p>

<p>And last but not least, you want the straight up <a href="http://ror4real.com">Ruby on Rails for Real</a> workshop most of all, followed by the <a href="http://rails4ios.com">Rails for iOS Developers</a>, so that will be what we schedule for November and January.  A reasonable number of people are wanting the Intro to Ruby as well, and I am certain that <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com/events/location/calgary/">Ladies Learning Code</a> will be running that workshop again soon as well, so keep an eye out for that.  Oh, and I had one "write in" for RubyMotion.  That's on my radar for next year.   </p>

<p>Thanks again. I'll post a schedule as soon as I've firmed up the dates. If you are not already on my <a href="http://mad.ly/signups/29211/join">mailing list</a>, please do <a href="http://mad.ly/signups/29211/join">signup</a>, and you'll be the first to hear as well as get special, list only, discount codes for workshops.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Core Data in Motion - the Gems</title>
      <link>/blog/core-data-in-motion-the-gems</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At long last, <a href="http://coredatainmotion.com">Core Data in Motion</a>, my book that helps RubyMotion developers get up to speed with Core Data in their RubyMotion projects, is complete.</p>

<p>So, what is RubyMotion? <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/tour/why-rubymotion/">RubyMotion</a> enables you to write cross-platform applications for iOS, Android, and OS X in Ruby. Instead of using the painfully verbose syntax of Objective-C, or taking a chance on the not-quite-ready-for-production Swift language, you can use the programming language that was designed to make programming fun to develop your iOS applications.</p>

<p>And what is Core Data? Core Data is to iOS and OS X development what ActiveRecord is to Rails. It solves all the hard problems involved in your data stack. To quote <a href="http://sealedabstract.com/code/you-should-use-core-data/">Drew Crawford</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are saving more than 3 objects to disk without linking to CoreData.framework, you’re doing it wrong. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This final chapter of Core Data in Motion is an epic look at the available gems and CocoaPods that can simplify and streamline your Core Data code. It weighs in at more that double the size of any of the other chapters in the book. </p>

<p>My reviewers have given fantastic feedback on this chapter, and I know you will find it extremely helpful, when trying to figure out which gem or CocoaPod will be most useful to speed along the development of your application.</p>

<p>Each gem is demonstrated, as I walk you through the process of transforming the base Core Data API's used in the book's sample project, into the gem's specific API. I also discuss the problems and issues I discovered along the way, so you can see what happens, and avoid those problems in your project.</p>

<p>It's been a long time coming, but Core Data in Motion will definitely give you the boost into using Core Data that you need, and save you hours and days of investigation and frustration.</p><iframe data-preserve-html-node="true" src="http://coredatainmotion.com/buy-button.html" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="349" width="500" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></iframe>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Screw you, too, Rogers</title>
      <link>/blog/screw-you-too-rogers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been a Rogers customer since my first cell phone, which was a very long time ago.  Sure, every once in a while, I get this twinge because their coverage sucks in rural areas (like where all my in-laws live), but I've put up with that, because when I am visiting family I mostly don't want to be interrupted by work anyway.</p>

<p>I've also experienced the super extreme rip off of international roaming.  But Telus does the same, and that's an easily solved problem. I got a Roam Mobility SIM for my US travels ($20 SIM + $14.95/GB), and a nice little mifi device that I can load up with 3 GB of data for 30 euro when I am in the UK, the equivalent of 10 euro/GB.  That's a little better than Rogers, where I'd be spending $400/GB with one of their "special" travel packs.  Ouch.  So ... same shit, different provider, whatever.</p>

<p>But the last straw came with my most recent Rogers bill.  It seemed unusually high, so I double checked with my previous bill.  And yup, it was almost $50 more.  After digging into the details, I discovered that I was charged $48.49 for a data overage.</p>

<p>Now, I get that you have a limit, and you get charged to go over.  What I don't get, is the EXTREME ripoff of those overage charges.  Let's review this in detail shall we?</p>

<p>I get charged $35/6GB right now.  This is the original iPhone data plan, that I have been using since my original iPhone.  Since that first, locked, phone I got from Rogers, I've never "upgraded", and I've always gotten my own unlocked phone from Apple.  So they aren't subsidising my phones, either.  I'll even leave out the fact that I get ripped off on my iPad data plan, since I last upgraded and the new device was "inelligible" for data sharing on that 6GB plan, so I had to get a separate plan for it.  </p>

<p>Since I am good at the maths, let me illustrate exactly WHY I feel ripped off.  On that plan, I get $35/6GB or:</p>

<p><code>
$5.83 / 1 GB
</code></p>

<p>I was over my 6GB (6000MB) limit by 900 MB.  That would make the $48.49/0.9GB equivalent to: </p>

<p><code>
$53.87 / 1 GB
</code></p>

<p>Yah.  That.  The fuckers are charging me almost 10 times the original rate for an overage. And that is why Rogers just lost me as a customer.  Not because they charge extra for going over.  I would understand that.  But double or triple the rate.  Not 10 fucking times the rate.  That's just unconscionable price gouging.</p>

<p>So, screw you, too, Rogers.  Next week, when I have the time, I'll be hitting up the Telus store and they'll have my $150/month account from now on.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/blog/core-data-with-nsfetchedresultscontroller-in-rubymotion</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Updated July 12, 2015.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Today we'll be continuing our series on <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://coredatainmotion.com">Core Data in RubyMotion</a>, discussing table view optimization of large amounts of data in your RubyMotion application.  If you've missed the earlier posts, you can find them here:</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/core-data-load-optimization-in-rubymotion">Core Data Load Optimization in RubyMotion</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Once again, we turn to Ray Wenderlich for inspiration and instruction.  His <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/999/core-data-tutorial-for-ios-how-to-use-nsfetchedresultscontroller">Core Data tutorial</a> wraps up with a post on the usage of <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsController</code>, so we should probably talk about that as well.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Why do we want to use <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsController</code>, anyway?  What's so special about it?  When we started this series, with a relatively small sample dataset, it didn't really need much optimization.  Now that we've loaded our database up with all 244,292 wells, it definitely needs some help, because I don't want my customers to wait <em data-preserve-html-node="true">minutes</em> for the table view to load, which is what it does at this point. That is what I would call a fetch <em data-preserve-html-node="true">FAIL</em>.</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1325.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/55a30b61e4b0359ca412be9e/1436748642620/fetch-fail.jpg" alt="Source: http://sadmoment.com/dog-meets-tree-while-playing-fetch-in-the-park-with-a-frisbee/"/> Source: http://sadmoment.com/dog-meets-tree-while-playing-fetch-in-the-park-with-a-frisbee/[/caption] 
  

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">We will need to reduce memory overhead, and improve the response time of our table view, now that we have all that data.  Ideally, in a table view, we would only load up the data that is actually visible to the user at any given moment.  And <em data-preserve-html-node="true">that</em> is exactly what the utility class <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsController</code> provides.  Let's see how that is accomplished in RubyMotion.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">First of all, we create an <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsController</code>. Since this object requires access to the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSManagedObjectContext</code>, which is in our store class, that's where we will put it.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">  <code data-preserve-html-node="true">def fetched_results_controller
    fetch_request = NSFetchRequest.alloc.init
    fetch_request.entity = NSEntityDescription.entityForName('FailedBankInfo', inManagedObjectContext:@context)
    sort = NSSortDescriptor.alloc.initWithKey("details.close_date", ascending: false)
    fetch_request.sortDescriptors = [sort]
    fetch_request.fetchBatchSize = 20

    NSFetchedResultsController.alloc.initWithFetchRequest(fetch_request,
                                                managedObjectContext:@context,
                                               sectionNameKeyPath:nil,
                                               cacheName:"Root")
  end</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The key to the construction of the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsController</code> is providing a base <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchRequest</code>.  This request needs to know which entity (a.k.a. model) is being fetched, and also requires an <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSSortDescriptor</code> so it knows in what order to return the requested objects.  The <code data-preserve-html-node="true">fetchBatchSize</code> simply limits the number of objects returned on any single query to the database.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now that we can create our <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsController</code>, where do we call it?  In this case, we will be creating it in our table view controller's <code data-preserve-html-node="true">viewDidLoad</code> method.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">  <code data-preserve-html-node="true">def viewDidLoad
    super
    error_ptr = Pointer.new(:object)
    @fetch_controller = FailedBankStore.shared.fetched_results_controller
    @fetch_controller.delegate = self
    unless @fetch_controller.performFetch(error_ptr)
      raise "Error when fetching banks: #{error_ptr[0].description}"
    end
  end</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Here we create the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsController</code>, set it's delegate to be self, and trigger the initial fetch to populate table view.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Next, we need to update the table view, so that it knows to get it's data from the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsController</code>.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">  <code data-preserve-html-node="true">def tableView(tableView, numberOfRowsInSection:section)
    @fetch_controller.sections.objectAtIndex(section).numberOfObjects
  end

  def configureCell(cell, atIndexPath:index)
    bank = @fetch_controller.objectAtIndexPath(index)
    cell.textLabel.text = bank.name
    cell.detailTextLabel.text = "#{bank.city}, #{bank.state}"
    return cell
  end

  CellID = 'CellIdentifier'
  def tableView(tableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath)
    cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(CellID) || UITableViewCell.alloc.initWithStyle(UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle, reuseIdentifier:CellID)
    configureCell(cell, atIndexPath:indexPath)
  end</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">These methods translate over from Ray's tutorial pretty much intact, without much change, other than the "rubyization".</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I did sort of skip a step back there, so let's not forget about that.  In <code data-preserve-html-node="true">viewDidLoad</code> we set the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsController</code>'s delegate to be self.  Now, we have to implement the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate</code>'s signature methods.  Ray simply copied his implementation from an Apple sample.  And I've simply converted his code into a Ruby module.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">module NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate

  def controllerWillChangeContent(controller)
    self.tableView.beginUpdates
  end

  def controller(controller, didChangeObject:object, atIndexPath:path, forChangeType:type, newIndexPath:new_path)
    tableView = self.tableView
    case type
      when NSFetchedResultsChangeInsert
        tableView.insertRowsAtIndexPaths([new_path], withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade)
      when NSFetchedResultsChangeDelete
        tableView.deleteRowsAtIndexPaths([path], withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade)
      when NSFetchedResultsChangeUpdate
        configureCell(tableView.cellForRowAtIndexPath(path), atIndexPath:path)
      when NSFetchedResultsChangeMove
        tableView.deleteRowsAtIndexPaths([path], withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade)
        tableView.insertRowsAtIndexPaths([new_path], withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade)
    end
  end

  def controller(controller, sectionIndexTitleForSectionName:sectionName)
  end

  def controller(controller, didChangeSection:section, atIndex:index, forChangeType:type)
    case type
      when NSFetchedResultsChangeInsert
        self.tableView.insertSections( NSIndexSet.indexSetWithIndex(index), withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade)
      when NSFetchedResultsChangeDelete
        self.tableView.deleteSections( NSIndexSet.indexSetWithIndex(index), withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade)
    end
  end

  def controllerDidChangeContent(controller)
    self.tableView.endUpdates
  end
end</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Then we must include that module in our table view controller, to satisfy the requirements of the delegate:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true">  <code data-preserve-html-node="true">class FailedBankTableViewController &lt; UITableViewController
  include NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">It looks like a lot of code, but if you only need to display data, and you don't need to change it much, you should just be able to reuse this module when required.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">And that, as they say, is that.  We now have a working implementation of <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsController</code>, and the data will only be loaded 20 objects at a time.  This speeds things up immensely, and reduces memory usage in our app from get-killed-immediately to just fine ;-)  The complete <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://github.com/wndxlori/WNDXRubyMotion/tree/nsfetchedresultscontroller/FailedBankCD">example</a> can be downloaded and run.  Alas, I am unable to provide the "large data load" that I used, as that data is not mine to give away.  I encourage you to come up with your own large data set, and plug it in, and see how it works.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">What's next after this?  Since one of the strengths of Ruby (and thus RubyMotion) is it's rich eco-system of gems, we should take all a look at what is available for use with Core Data.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Until then…</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Updated June 26, 2015</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Once again, we are talking about using Core Data in <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://rubymotion.com">RubyMotion</a>.  If you've missed the earlier posts, you can find them here:</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/core-data-in-motion">Introduction to Core Data in Motion</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/core-data-relationships-in-rubymotion">Core Data Relationships in RubyMotion</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">This week, we are delving into loading up that Core Data store with a pre-populated set of data.  Once again, Ray Wenderlich's Core Data tutorial offers us a great starting point. <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/12170/core-data-tutorial-how-to-preloadimport-existing-data-updated">Core Data on iOS 5 Tutorial: How To Preload and Import Existing Data</a></p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">When I initially started this series, this tutorial had not be re-written.  It eventually ended up at the same place I did, however, so let's just start at the beginning, and see how we eventually get there.  Just as a reminder, all the code for this series is based on Ray's example, and can be found <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="I%20have%20created%20a%20RubyMotion%20project%20to%20illustrate%20this%20based%20on%20his%20%22Failed%20Banks%22%20example.%20%20You%20can%20find%20my%20project%20[here](https://github.com/wndxlori/WNDXRubyMotion/tree/master/FailedBankCD">here</a>. And all the code relevant to this post can be found in this <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://github.com/wndxlori/WNDXRubyMotion/tree/import-preload-data">branch</a>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In the <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/core-data-basics-in-rubymotion">basics</a> and <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/core-data-relationships-in-rubymotion">relationships</a> posts, we have already created our models, dealt with the persistent store coordinator, managed object context, and the managed object model, and then wired our models together with relationships.  So that is our starting point for this exercise.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">This is our load function, as translated from Ray's example, to start.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">def self.load
    # Finds and opens the json file, from the resources dir, which contains the data to be loaded
    path = NSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResource("Banks", ofType:"json")
    banks = BW::JSON.parse(NSData.dataWithContentsOfFile(path))
    puts(banks)
    banks.each do |bank|
      FailedBankStore.shared.add_bank do |info, details|
        info.name = bank['name']
        info.city = bank['city']
        info.state = bank['state']
        details.close_date = NSDate.dateWithNaturalLanguageString(bank['closeDate'])
        details.update_date = NSDate.date
        details.zip = bank['zip']
        info.details = details
      end
    end
  end</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">That's a bit of a wall of text, so let's break it down.  First step, finding the JSON file that contains the data, and reading it in.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true"># Finds and opens the json file, from the resources dir, which 
    # contains the data to be loaded
    path = NSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResource("Banks", ofType:"json")
    banks = BW::JSON.parse(NSData.dataWithContentsOfFile(path))</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The JSON file - <code data-preserve-html-node="true">Banks.json</code>', is located in your RubyMotion project's <code data-preserve-html-node="true">resources</code> directory.  Then we use the ever-useful <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://bubblewrap.io">BubbleWrap</a> library's JSON methods to read in the data.  This yields to us an array of bank objects, which are essentially Hashes.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Since we have an array, we'll now iterate through it, and <code data-preserve-html-node="true">add_bank</code> for each, populating the bank info and bank detail entities with the related values.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">banks.each do |bank|
      FailedBankStore.shared.add_bank do |info, details|
        info.name = bank['name']
        info.city = bank['city']
        info.state = bank['state']
        details.close_date = NSDate.dateWithNaturalLanguageString(bank['closeDate'])
        details.update_date = NSDate.date
        details.zip = bank['zip']
        info.details = details
      end
    end</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">For clarity's sake, it's probably worth a look at the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">add_bank</code> method, which simply creates and yields the new bank info and bank details entities for us, and saves the populated objects into the managed context.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">def add_bank
    # Yield a blank, newly created bank entity, then save the model.
    yield NSEntityDescription.insertNewObjectForEntityForName('FailedBankInfo', inManagedObjectContext:@context),
        NSEntityDescription.insertNewObjectForEntityForName('FailedBankDetails', inManagedObjectContext:@context)
    save
  end</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now that we have all that, all we have to do is run our project in the simulator (<code data-preserve-html-node="true">rake</code>), and invoke <code data-preserve-html-node="true">FailedBankStore.load</code> from the REPL, and bingo, we have a pre-populated SQLite database.  The next time you run your app, you'll see the all the data you just loaded.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">That seems pretty simple, doesn't it?  And it is.  Pretty simple.  Or maybe I should say, pretty simplistic.  This actually works quite well, with a relatively small data set.  This example, with a working set of data, can be downloaded and run from this <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://github.com/wndxlori/WNDXRubyMotion/tree/import-preload-data">branch</a> of the repository.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">However, once you start dealing with larger datasets (mine had 244,292 items), you will find this simple case breaks down rapidly. How we deal with really large datasets is, of course, our next topic. :-)</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Until then…</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">If you found this post enlightening, you will find the ebook I wrote on these topics (and more) will allow you to spend more time working on your iOS application features, instead of fighting with Core Data for hours (or days).</p>

      <title>Core Data in Motion - Chapter 2</title>
      <link>/blog/core-data-in-motion-chapter-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, Core Data and relationships.  Lots of iOS apps are small, so why wouldn't you just smoosh all your data into one big model?</p>

<p>Performance. Memory. Speed. </p>

<p>With Core Data, you cannot simply retrieve only certain attributes from a object.  For instance, in my WIMBY application, we have a rather huge monolithic well table, with about 20 attributes for each well.  When we want to display these on a map, we only need 4 of those 20 attributes.  A unique identifier,  "label" for the pin, and the latitude and longitude values for map coordinates.  To be memory/bandwidth efficient, we would only select the 4 attributes we actually need when retrieving the data from the database.  In Rails ActiveRecord parlance, that would be something like:</p>

<p><code>
     Well.select(:uwi, :well_name, :surface_latitude, :surface_longitude)
</code></p>

<p>In this <code>Well.select</code> statement, we have only 4 attributes out of our original 20. This saves us approximately 80% of the memory/bandwidth of a full record retrieval, which most programmers would think was a Good Thing&trade;.  The only problem here is, we can't do that in Core Data.</p>

<p>WAT?</p>

<p>Yup, in Core Data, fetches will return either object ID's <strong>only</strong> or whole objects <strong>only</strong>.  There is no way to refine that fetch with a select clause, like we have in SQL or ORM tools like ActiveRecord.</p>

<p>In our particular case of the well table, Core Data will either fetch entire objects, chewing up 5x the amount of memory that we actually need, or fetch only object ID's, and then lazily fetch each object as it is accessed.  In case you haven't run into THIS particular problem before, it's called the <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=n%2B1+query">N+1 Query</a> problem, and it will have a significant effect on the speed of your application. Your choice here is between MOAR MEMORY or MOAR SLOW.</p>

<p>So how do we make make our object fetches more performant in Core Data?</p>

<p>This is accomplished through decomposing our monolithic models into several distinct models with one-to-one relationships between each model (entity).  Each model contains only the information necessary for the view in which it will be used.  In the hot-off-the-presses Chapter 2 of <a href="http://coredatainmotion.com">Core Data in Motion</a>, we examine, in detail, how to accomplish this.</p><iframe data-preserve-html-node="true" src="http://coredatainmotion.com/buy-button.html" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="349" width="500" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></iframe>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Core Data has selects</title>
      <link>/blog/core-data-has-selects</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-preserve-html-node="true">After my last post, there was an interesting side discussion on Twitter (with @macfanatic and @kastiglione) about some alternatives.  It was interesting enough that I thought it would make good material for another post.  So here ya go!</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">So, to revisit the last post <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/core-data-in-motion-chapter-2">Core Data in Motion - Chapter 2</a>, we discussed the notion that Core Data doesn't really have the notion of a "select" clause.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">What is the impact of this limitation?</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">If you have a large monolithic model, but just wanted a subset of the attributes for your current view, like, say a MAP, you'd probably want to do something similar to the ActiveRecord query:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">     Well.select(:uwi, :well_name, :surface_latitude, :surface_longitude)
</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">But you can't do that in Core Data.  When you execute a Core Data fetch, you get the option of getting back object ids <strong data-preserve-html-node="true">only</strong> or whole objects <strong data-preserve-html-node="true">only</strong>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Or can you?</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">That was the point under discussion on Twitter.  There is actually another option, but it comes with its own limitations.  So let's take a look at that other option, and see what it gives us, and what it takes away.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">If you look at the SDK docs for <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchRequest</code>, you will see a method called <code data-preserve-html-node="true">setPropertiesToFetch</code>.  The SDK description for this method is:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">Specifies which properties should be returned by the fetch. The 
property descriptions may represent attributes, one-to-one
relationships, or expressions. The name of an attribute or
relationship description must match the name of a description 
on the fetch request’s entity.

Parameters:
    values (Array) — An array of NSPropertyDescription objects that 
    specify which properties should be returned by the fetch.

Returns:
    (Object)
</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Hey!  So you can get your <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchRequest</code> to return only this specified subset of properties!  Isn't that just like a select?</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Well, not quite.  You see, when you run the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchRequest</code> with the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">propertiesToFetch</code> specified, it will still <strong data-preserve-html-node="true">ignore</strong> your <code data-preserve-html-node="true">propertiesToFetch</code>, unless you have also specified a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">resultType</code> of <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSDictionaryResultType</code>. This is detailed in the answer to this <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7698909/nsfetchrequest-with-distinct-properties">Stack Overflow question</a>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Then, when you run the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchRequest</code> with some <code data-preserve-html-node="true">propertiesToFetch</code> and a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">resultType</code> of <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSDictionaryResultType</code> you get back an array of <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSDictionary</code> items,  <strong data-preserve-html-node="true">NOT</strong> your <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSManagedObjects</code>.  So your results won't have any of the methods you've declared on those <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSManagedObjects</code>, like, for instance, if you implemented the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">MKAnnotation</code> interface so that you can drop those results on an <code data-preserve-html-node="true">MKMapView</code> (which was my particular issue with this).</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">I will further note that the <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7698909/nsfetchrequest-with-distinct-properties">Stack Overflow post</a> also indicates that the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchedResultsController</code> doesn't play nicely with <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSDictionaryResultsType</code>, which would limit it's usefulness with most standard <code data-preserve-html-node="true">UITableViewControllers</code> implementations, too.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">So... I can't use these results on my map, and it won't play nicely with my list view, either. I'm sure it's useful in some use cases, but its limitations made it useless for both of mine, so this is where <code data-preserve-html-node="true">NSFetchRequest.propertiesToFetch</code> and I parted company.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Chapter 3 of <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="http://book.coredatainmotion.com">Core Data in Motion</a> (Preloading Data) is now available, and I've added the information from this post as an update to Chapter 2 as an extra bonus. As always, I welcome your feedback, especially when it helps me improve the book like this discussion has done.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>2014 Year in Review + 2015 Goals</title>
      <link>/blog/2014-year-in-review-2015-goals</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year was just crazy.  I was attempting to finish writing my book, work some contracts, speak at two conferences, teach my Rails workshop, mentor and teach at a couple of Ladies Learning Code/ChicGeekYYC events, and just for shiggles, my husband and I picked up and moved to a new (old) city - Lethbridge.</p>

<p>In retrospect, it isn't really surprising that I didn't actually finish primary writing on the book until Dec 31.  Other than finishing the book, and planning to move out of Calgary, I didn't really have a master plan last year.  And you know what they say about planning... </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Failing to plan is planning to fail. - Alan Lakein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This year should be a little more sane.  I'm laying out some goals, and trying to concentrate on building up my "products" business, finally making progress on my <a href="https://unicornfree.com/2015/guest-post-no-excuses-left-this-year-i-get-serious">30x500</a> learnings.</p>

<p>Before looking forward, however, I need to get an idea of where I currently stand. Taking the cue from some of my <a href="https://unicornfree.com/2015/12-of-our-bootstrapping-students-to-watch-in-2015">fellow 30x500 alumni</a>, I decided I should post my product business results from last year. Got onto <a href="https://stripe.com/ca">Stripe</a>, downloaded my transaction history, and summed everything up:</p>

<p><img src="/s/Screenshot-2015-01-09-135425.png" alt="WNDX Products Revenue" title=""></p>

<p>Ok, that % increase on the book is kind of lame, since I only sold one copy in Dec 2013, but the overall revenue numbers were still a nice uptick, year over year. I guess I’m still in that constant battle with impostor syndrome, and I didn’t keep track regularly, because I didn’t think I was doing that well, considering that I was still pretty much half-assing my way along last year.</p>

<p>Now I have the numbers on which to base my goals for the next year. Drum roll, please... </p>

<ol>
<li>Marketing the <a href="http://coredatainmotion.com">Core Data in Motion</a> book</li>
<li>Create new <a href="http://www.wndx.com/workshops/">Advanced Rails Workshop</a></li>
<li>Schedule/deliver <a href="http://www.wndx.com/workshops/">Rails/Advanced Rails/Rails4iOS workshops</a> quarterly</li>
<li>Finish my damn iOS application - WIMBY</li>
<li>Establish a <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code</a> Lethbridge Chapter &amp; and host at least one workshop</li>
</ol>

<p>Marketing the now-finished (just waiting for comments from one more reviewer before pushing the final) book is pretty much a no-brainer.  </p>

<p>Creating the new workshop is one of the "brick building" exercises we learn from 30x500, and is also a no-brainer, considering how many requests I have had for it.</p>

<p>Obviously, I can't make any money from workshops if I don't get them scheduled.  Seems like I get busy, and then forget, and then it's a bad time of year or whatever.  I mean... I scheduled a workshop on Grey Cup weekend one time (#facepalm).  So, we'll get those lined up, with real dates, sooner rather than later this year.</p>

<p>The iOS application is a bit of a soft goal.  I need to finish it, because it's been languishing at the 80% finished level for too long.  It's not really planned as a revenue generator, directly, but it was the spur behind my book, so there's that.  And then I can say I am a published iOS developer, so there's that, too.  iOS and Android developers seem to have a LOT of pains, so that is a fruitful area for future sales safaris.</p>

<p>I also want to continue my volunteer work in conjunction with Ladies Learning Code, to improve the levels of diversity in software development.  Lethbridge may be small, but it has both a university and a college, so I fully expect to be able to host workshops here quarterly, as I get the Lethbridge Chapter ramped up. (<a href="http://www.wndx.com/contact/">Contact</a> me if you are interested in helping out!)</p>

<p>So there we have it.  Last year I had a 300% increase in revenue.  I don't think it's a stretch to go for 500% this year (not a goal, but a good measuring stick of progress), since I am buckling down with these definite goals.  Instead of leaving my revenue checkup for the end of the year, this year I'll be doing that at least quarterly, so I can tell what sort of progress I am making.</p>

<p>If you'd like to keep in touch, you can always <a href="http://www.wndx.com/contact/">contact</a> me directly, or you can <a href="http://mad.ly/signups/29211/join">sign up for my mailing list</a>, and get advance notice about workshops and special discounts for my products not offered elsewhere.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Re-discovering Lethbridge</title>
      <link>/blog/discovering-lethbridge</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here it is, the end of January. This marks exactly a year since my husband and I were "just checking out" the housing market in Lethbridge, Alberta and fell in love with our money-pit of a property.  I have another whole post drafted on how we arrived at our decision to move, so I'll leave that to another time, and just talk about what we've discovered about our new-old home town in that year.</p>
  
      <a href="http://www.lethbridge.ca/Things-To-Do/About-Lethbridge/PublishingImages/101027-_MG_4005.jpg"  target="_blank" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/54cc1ca5e4b05d8fda8b4ba9/1422662828265/101027-_MG_4005.jpg" alt=""/></a>
  

<p>I grew up in Lethbridge, so I thought I knew a lot about this place.  In the time since I left to go to university in Calgary, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethbridge">Lethbridge</a> has grown a lot.  It is over double the size it was when I left, with a population of over 93,000.  It was, and remains, a university town, with both the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Lethbridge">University of Lethbridge</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethbridge_College">Lethbridge College</a> now contributing 8600 and 4000 students respectively to the local population.  That youthful influx each year gives the city a more modern vibe than I remember from my childhood.</p>

<p>Lethbridge also claims a more diversified economy than its' big sibling cities of Alberta.  It's not as chained to the oil economy as Calgary and Red Deer, nor as government-bound as Edmonton.  It is southern Alberta's commercial, distribution, financial and industrial centre.  While in the past, Lethbridge's economy was primarily agricultural, the Economic Development Lethbridge (EDL) organization, created in 2002, has started to have a significant impact. </p>

<p>As an avid Twitter user, I started building my list of <a href="https://twitter.com/wndxlori/lists/yql-talk-to-me">#yql</a> people to follow after we committed to the move. In the fall, I stumbled across an EDL event called <a href="http://lethbridgechamber.chambermaster.com/events/details/tec-mingle-1798">tec &amp; mingle</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.tecconnect.ca">tecconnect</a>.  I had no idea that Lethbridge had it's own tech incubator.  Nor that it was fast becoming a world-leader in geo-spatial technologies.  There's even a Tier 3 data centre, owned and operated by <a href="http://www.blackbridge.com">BlackBridge Technologies</a>.</p>

<p>tec &amp; mingle was an interesting event, where we got to meet numerous members of the local tech community, and drool over interesting technologies like the UAV drones of <a href="http://isisgeo.com">Ventus Geospatial</a> used to collect aerial imagery and perform 3D mapping.  Spent some time chatting with <a href="https://twitter.com/crabl">Chris Rabl</a>, a front-end developer with <a href="http://autovance.com">Autovance</a>, and saw a demo of their interesting software product that is helping car dealerships streamline their financing options. And I got to run into old school friends, like Alan Schneider, who is now executive director of the <a href="http://lethbridgecommunitynetwork.com">Lethbridge Community Network</a>, providing support for not-for-profits with IT and computer services.</p>

<p>While my husband and I may have had a few lingering doubts about leaving the big city, I have to say that those doubts have been completely laid to rest, and I am excited by the opportunities available in our new-old home town.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Fourth R</title>
      <link>/blog/the-fourth-r</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's all sorts of stories and reasons behind the lack of women in software development, and I'm not planning on debating which or how influential any of them are.  I'll just pick one to start with here.  We call it "the pipeline".  It's really hard to increase the percentage of women in software development jobs, when the percentage of young women entering the field remains so ridiculously low.  </p>

<h3 id="whyisitridiculouslylow">Why is it ridiculously low?</h3>

<p>Young women, and really before that, young girls, are convinced that programming is boring, where you are just locked up in a room with a computer pounding out code 24/7.  That is such a narrow and really misleading look at the profession that it just breaks my heart. Good programmers need to understand, deeply, the fields related to what they are programming, in order to do a good job.  Good software developers need to be people-persons, to work with the users/customers of their software, to determine their needs, and to help them solve problems that they never even realized they had.    </p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/54d53931e4b05da7d773c24a/1423259957411//img.png" alt=""/>
  

<blockquote>
  <p>But here's a good starting place: The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. -- <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding">npr.org</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The simple fact is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">women</a> were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">programming</a> long before boys, when it was thought that programming was a "clerical" type of skill.  Once the boys figured out it was more important than that, they made certain to elbow the women out of the way, quick enough.  Follow that up with some really good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CDkHs4lzUos.">ad campaigns</a> that make it clear that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxNjx_VWJ8U">computers are for boys</a>, and now we have a self-fulfilling prophesy of a male-dominated profession, because there are not enough women mentors, and there is a lack of young women even wanting to enter in the pipeline into the field of software development.
So let's fix that at the very start.  </p>

<p>Shouldn't computer science be like reading/writing/arithmetic? Get kids, really young kids, learning how to program.  Have a progression of skills that are taught and practiced throughout their school years.</p>

<p>(Ok, there never were 3 R's so don't bug me about that 4th one, mmmk?)</p>

<p>We teach reading and writing and arithmetic right from the get-go in schools.  But computers are part of the new literacy, so using computers, and TALKING to computers, and telling computers what to do is a basic skill that needs to be engendered right along with those other three.</p>

<p>Introduced at an early enough stage, it becomes "just something you do", and not something related to video games or logic skills or math skills or whatever reason people pick to assume that boys are good at it while girls are not.  </p>

<p>I would also argue that programming is a "maker" skill, and kids love to make things.  Programming is making something with your mind, in collaboration with the computer.  There is a joy involved in creating something new.  Kids feel that way about their art projects, why not about their programs?  What I'd really love to see is Facebook and Pinterest &amp; Instagram filling up with links to my friends' kids' programming projects, much like their art projects show up on your fridge now.  </p>

<p>"Look at this neat thing my kid made"</p>

<h3 id="whydontwehavethisalready">Why don't we have this already?</h3>

<p>I'm doing my part.  In a couple of weeks, I'm teaching the Girls Learning Code <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com/events/introduction-ruby-9-12-year-old-girls/">Ruby Workshop</a>.  We can always use more mentors, which will help us get some of those girls OFF the waiting list, and into the class!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the opportunity last week to teach one of the Calgary based <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com/chapters/calgary/">Girls Learning Code workshops</a> for the first time.  It was quite a learning experience, for everyone, so I thought I'd write up some of the fun things we learned.</p>
  
      <a href="http://calgary.ladieslearningcode.com"  target="_blank" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/54f11ecbe4b0376cee6be391/1425088215970//img.png" alt=""/></a>
  


<p>I was asked if I'd be interested in teaching this workshop back in December, and I immediately said yes.  Having already taught and mentored for the Ladies Learning Code workshops, I thought teaching kids would be fun.  Like the LLC workshop, I knew that this workshop had already been given in Toronto, and that the materials from that would be available.</p>

<p>Ksenia asked me to review the materials, so I did.  It looked like a "dumbed down", shorter version of the adult workshop.  In a fit of laziness, I just said it would be fine.  However, when Ksenia followed up with me, and mentioned that the material was a little ... dry, and lacking in "fun factor", I had to confess to having similar thoughts.  So, I started investigating ways of making the workshop "more fun".</p>

<p>The first thing that sprung to mind was <a href="http://kidsruby.com">KidsRuby.com</a>.  After a quick review of the website, and some of the training materials, I was sold, especially since KidsRuby has embedded <a href="http://artoo.io">Artoo.io</a>, and you can program ROBOTS with it.  I have a 13 year old nephew, and he absolutely loves the <a href="http://www.gosphero.com">Sphero</a> I got him as a Christmas present, after seeing the Artoo.io intro at RubyConf 2013.</p>

<iframe data-preserve-html-node="true" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43tctP24Xmo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that KidsRuby is in a bit of flux at the moment.  The installers don't work on the most <a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/kidsrubyinstaller-osx/issues/11">recent releases of OSes</a>.  It seemed to me that if we couldn't guarantee it would run for all the students in the class, we really couldn't use it.  I did download the source materials for the installer and attempt to get the installer building/working so that I could fix it up, but I had problems with it, and no one was able to respond to my problem reports over the period of a <a href="(https://github.com/hybridgroup/kidsrubyinstaller-osx/issues/11">couple of weeks</a>), so I had to give it up. (Not throwing blame around here.  Open source can be a labour of love, but sometimes real life gets in the way.  I was on a schedule, however...)</p>

<p>So, we defaulted back to the basic RubyInstaller, the command-line, and editing files with Sublime Text.  Not ideal for kids, and certainly more work for the mentors, but it was good enough.</p>

<p>Now, about those course materials...</p>

<p>I reviewed some of it, in an overview fashion, with my nephew.  He agreed with my first impression that the Twitter example wouldn't be that interesting to kids.  In his words... "Everyone HAS a Twitter account, but no one actually USES it."  So, the Twitter example had to go. </p>

<p>A second issue arose from that review.  The Madlibs examples are cool and a lot of fun.  But the original class was presented to 13 year olds, who could all be expected to understand the parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs).  In our class, we had 8-13 year olds (actually, we also had a couple 6 year olds o_O).  At least some of those would need help with the parts of speech, so we added a quick little grammar review, and wrote some examples on the white boards during the workshop, so that the kids had help with their Madlib exercise. Lots of giggling involved, so I think they enjoyed it.</p>

<p>One thing did stick from KidsRuby - Robots.  Because robots are cool.  I bargained with my nephew, and he agreed to let me "borrow" his Sphero for the workshop, if he was allowed to come along.  Seemed fair to me.  He &amp; I spent a fun afternoon getting everything set up to have a Robots! demo at the end of the workshop with his Sphero.</p>

<p>Cribbing heavily from the <a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/kidsruby-class-1">KidsRuby class notes</a>, we replaced the Twitter stuff with some new basic logic material, and I introduced some basics on looping.  The final version of the class material used is in this Github branch <a href="https://github.com/wndxlori/glc-ruby/tree/yyc-feb21">here</a>. Once we covered all that, I was pretty sure that the students would be able to grasp the Artoo.io Sphero demo code without too much trouble.  </p>

<p>I sent all that to Ksenia.  She also suggested an "icebreaker" exercise at the beginning of the class, which was an excellent idea, and got the girls very engaged.</p>

<p>All in all, I was happy that we prepared so well.  The workshop was well attended (most popular one so far!) with 22 students and 7 (or 8 or 9?) mentors, and went fairly smoothly.  Had one hiccup, when the USB sticks I had prepared (with backup downloads and course materials) ended up formatted only for Mac #facepalm, but one of our fabulous mentors, <a href="https://twitter.com/timuruski">Tim</a>, was able to quickly re-format enough copies for all the Windows-based students to use.  We did run out of time at the end, leaving the final exercise as "homework", but got our Sphero demo to run, just about the time that all the parents showed up to take the kids home.</p>

<p>I have to close by thanking the amazing Girls Learning Code team at <a href="http://thechicgeek.ca">@ChicGeekYYC</a>.  <a href="https://twitter.com/ksenia_nadkina">Ksenia</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/derushie">Darcie</a>, and Jocelyn put in an amazing amount of effort to run these workshops, and to make certain that they are free. And to thank all the mentors who helped make my job as instructor pretty easy.  I'm not certain if all the attendees and parents realize, but these Girls Learning Code workshops are free because of the efforts of the <a href="https://twitter.com/ChicGeekYYC">@ChicGeekYYC</a> team, the instructors, and the mentors, all volunteering their time to teach coding skills to young girls.  And, of course, the sponsors like <a href="https://twitter.com/AssemblyCS">@AssemblyCS</a>, who donate their spaces to hold these workshops.</p>

<p>I am already looking forward to new Girl's Learning Code workshops.  I hope to set up a chapter down home in Lethbridge before the year is out.  I know my nephew really enjoyed the workshop and is <em>extremely</em> interested in attending another, so I have hopes that the rest of the students enjoyed this one as much as he and I did.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Better Testing with RSpec</title>
      <link>/blog/bettertestingwithrspec</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let's get this one question out of the way, right off the bat.  Why RSpec?  or more specifically - why RSpec instead of MiniTest?</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/551dda23e4b06389c8205a32/1428019748396//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>For me, the answer was provided with a simple empirical test.  One of my junior developers desperately wanted us to use RSpec on our project instead of Test::Unit (precursor of MiniTest).  We decided it to give it a trial.  I don't think we wrote tests faster.  Or that the specs ran faster.  But... my fellow developers on this project wrote <em>better</em> tests <em>by far</em> than they had been writing using Test::Unit.</p>

<p>Better tests in this case mean... more finely grained, better focused.  Where before we wrote a single test with 15 or more asserts, now we wrote 8 or 10 specs, most with single expectations. </p>

<p>While I am certain that it was possible for these developers to write better, more finely grained tests using Test::Unit and a little discipline, I am also convinced that we wrote better tests <em>by default</em> in RSpec, because of the way in which the specs are structured, and described.</p>

<p>So ever since, I have advocated for RSpec on every project I work on.</p>

<p>Now, it does take a little longer to get up to speed using RSpec, but once you have the basics down, the rich environment of the RSpec core, combined with separate libraries for expectations &amp; mocking provide both power and flexibility.  If you don't like rspec-mock, you can go ahead and substitute the mocking/stubbing framework of your choice. And rspec-rails provides a drop-in replacement for the default Rails testing framework. </p>

<p>The RoR4Real Advanced Topics workshop - Better Testing with RSpec - will help you over that speed-bump of getting started using RSpec, and introduce you to the full power of the RSpec environment covering:</p>

<ul>
<li>RSpec basics
<ul><li>Setting up your project with RSpec</li>
<li>describe &amp; context blocks</li>
<li>expectations in detail</li>
<li>using test doubles</li>
<li>rspec-rails intro</li></ul></li>
<li>More advanced concepts
<ul><li>writing your own matchers</li>
<li>the power of factories</li>
<li>integration testing with Capybara</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So, to get back to the original question, "Why RSpec", let's see what one of the authors of <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book">The RSpec Book</a> had to say:</p>

<p><img data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://imagery.pragprog.com/products/140/achbd_xlargecover.jpg?1298589834" style="display:block;margin:auto;"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RSpec is not just about RSpec. It's about BDD. It's about encouraging
  conversation about testing and looking at it in different ways. It's
  about illuminating the design, specification, collaboration and
  documentation aspects of tests, and thinking of them as executable
  examples of behaviour.  -- David Chelimsky</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that's why I use RSpec.  If you'd like to write better tests in RSpec like a pro, you should sign up (and get 50% off!!) for one of my Advanced Rails Workshops now:</p>

      <title>Ladies Learning Code comes to Lethbridge</title>
      <link>/blog/ladies-learning-code-comes-to-lethbridge</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That's right, we now have an official Lethbridge Chapter of the Ladies Learning Code, with an <a href="mailto:lethbridge@ladieslearningcode.com">email</a>, and everything. </p>

<p>Back in January, I published my goals for 2015 <a href="http://www.wndx.com/blog/2014-year-in-review-2015-goals">here</a>, and the fifth goal was the establishment of a Lethbridge chapter for Ladies Learning Code, and to host at least one workshop here in Lethbridge in 2015.</p>
  
      <a href="http://ladieslearningcodeday.com/"  target="_blank" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/55ce68dbe4b083e448c3079b/1439590623705//img.png" alt=""/></a>
  

<p>To launch this chapter with a BANG, we are holding our first workshop in conjunction with the 3rd Annual <a href="http://ladieslearningcodeday.com/">National Learn To Code Day</a> on September 26, 2015.  With the help of <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://telus.com">Telus</a>, and the <b data-preserve-html-node="true">Government of Canada</b> we'll be teaching <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com/events/lethbridge/">Python</a> to absolute beginners!</p>

<p>I can now confirm that our volunteer instructor for the workshop is none other than <a href="http://directory.uleth.ca/users/j.rice">Jackie Rice</a>, Associate Dean of the University of Lethbridge, and one of the co-founders of the <a href="http://www.uleth.ca/artsci/math-computer-science/lumacs">LUMACS: life, u, mathematics and computer science</a> outreach program.</p>

<p>And thanks to our wonderful venue sponsor, <a href="https://twitter.com/tecconnectab">tecconnect</a>, we also have a great location to host our workshop.</p>

<p>If you are a non-Python programmer, but still interested in getting involved, you can <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com/get-involved/">sign up</a> to stay informed about our future workshops (like <a href="http://girlslearningcodeday.com">National Girls Learning Code Day</a>).  </p>

<p>All this is pretty exciting for me.  Many moons ago, when I last re-wrote my website, I added this to my passions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm also a card-carrying member of DevChix, a teacher at RailsBridge, and a mentor and instructor for Ladies Learning Code (Calgary).  Helping to make a career in software development into a more welcoming opportunity for all women is very, very important to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm very pleased to add "Chapter Lead (Lethbridge)" for Ladies Learning Code to that list, and I look forward to meeting you all on <a href="http://ladieslearningcodeday.com">National Learn to Code Day</a>.  If you have any questions at all, just shoot me an email : <a href="mailto:lethbridge@ladieslearningcode.com">lethbridge@ladieslearningcode.com</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why Python?</title>
      <link>/blog/why-python</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been hearing a number of questions, in relation to the National Learn to Code Day workshop, so I thought I should address those questions in a little more detail than you will find on our workshop <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/lethbridge-data-insights-with-python-for-beginners-on-september-26th-tickets-17610786336">registration page</a>.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/55fc85d4e4b0347ac88d07d7/1442612693898//img.png" alt=""/>
  

<h2 id="idontneedtolearntoprogram">I don't need to learn to program?</h2>

<p>An interesting fact, most people with a computer today have already been programming for years, and they don't even know it.  </p>

<p>Do you use Excel? Have you created rows and columns of numbers and summed them up, and entered formulas for calculating more complex results?  Congratulations!  YOU are a programmer. Excel (and other spreadsheet applications like it), does most of the heavy lifting for you, but those calculations and formulae in spreadsheets are another example of a very narrow, focused programming language.</p>

<p>This workshop, unlike a lot of classes you find online, is aimed at the <em>absolute beginner</em>. If you know absolutely nothing about coding or computer programming, this is the workshop for you!</p>

<h2 id="whynothtmlcss">Why not HTML &amp; CSS?</h2>

<p>In previous years, the Learn to Code Day workshop has been the Ladies Learning Code HTML &amp; CSS workshop, in which you learn to build a web page.  This is a fun and exciting workshop, if for no other reason than when you leave, you have something you can show off to all your friends &amp; family.</p>

<p>The thing is, HTML &amp; CSS are used to build web pages, and that's about it.</p>

<h2 id="whypython">Why Python?</h2>

<p>Python, on the other hand, is a <em>general purpose</em> programming language.  What does that mean?  It means that you can use it to create a web application, or you can program your <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/learning-python-with-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a> (teeny tiny credit card sized computer) or your your <a href="https://github.com/faulkner/sphero">Sphero</a> robot, or you can crunch numbers like a data scientist!</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/55fc861ee4b04c74c508a765/1442612767726//img.png" alt=""/>
  

<p>And by learning how to program with a general purpose programming language, you will find yourself gaining a <em>better</em> understanding of how the applications you use on your computer every day, like Excel, actually work and be able to use them more effectively.</p>

<h2 id="canguyssignup">Can guys sign up?</h2>

<p>While these workshops are sponsored by <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code</a>, this is <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com/codeday/">National Learn to Code Day</a>, so guys are welcome, too.  We just ask you guys to bring along a lady!</p>

<h2 id="howaboutgirls">How about girls?</h2>

<p>We will be offering girls/kids workshops in Lethbridge, too.  In fact, <a href="http://girlslearningcodeday.com">National Girls Learning Code Day</a> is coming up fast.  But if your young lady (11 and up) would really, really like to come to our workshop, they certainly can, but they will need to be accompanied by a parent/guardian. </p>

<h1 id="whereiansweryournationalgirlslearningcodedayquestions">Where I answer your National Girls Learning Code Day questions</h1>

<h2 id="whatisnationalgirlslearningcodedayallabout">What is National Girls Learning Code Day all about?</h2>

<p>It's about discovering a passion for learning about technology.</p>

<p>It's about experiencing the satisfaction that comes from being a builder/maker of the web and technology.</p>

<p>It's about building a simple one page website from scratch to share with friends and family.</p>

<p>And becoming more confident and self-assured and developing a willingness to try new things.</p>

<p>This is a beginner level workshop for girls 8-13 years old and their parent/guardian/aunt/older sibling. </p>

<h2 id="canboyssignup">Can boys sign up?</h2>

<p>These workshops are sponsored by <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code</a>, and this is <a href="http://girlslearningcodeday.com/">National Girls Learning Code Day</a>.  That said, as the local Lethbridge Chapter lead, I won't absolutely say no if a boy would really, really like to attend. But if he really wants to come, he should bring along a girl, too, like a sister or cousin or neighbourhood friend!</p>

<p>Or, boys can wait for our (not yet scheduled, but in the New Year) <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com/program/kids-learning-code/">Kids Learning Code</a> workshop, which will be focused on kids of all ages, not just girls.</p>

<h2 id="whatdoweneedtobring">What do we need to bring?</h2>

<p>The learners will need to bring a laptop to work on to the workshop.  If you don't have one, but would really like to participate, please contact me at <a href="mail:lethbridge@ladieslearningcode.com">this email</a>, and I'll do my best to find one you can borrow for the day!  </p>

<p>This workshop is BYOL, so each parent or guardian/youth pair will need to supply their own lunch as well.</p>

      <title>Don't Go Into Management</title>
      <link>/blog/dont-go-into-management</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was quite a while back, but I saved this tweet, because I thought I could write up a fairly epic blog post, related to the topic, so here goes.</p><p></p><blockquote data-preserve-html-node="true" class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p data-preserve-html-node="true" lang="en" dir="ltr">If you like to code, don’t go into management.</p>— Brianna Wu (@Spacekatgal) <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://twitter.com/Spacekatgal/status/426874288806068224">January 25, 2014</a></blockquote><script data-preserve-html-node="true" async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p></p><p>If you end up working as a developer, for any sort of large corporation, it is practically inevitable that you will be pressured to go into management.  This is doubly true for women.  What? you say... Yup, there is just as serious a gender gap in upper management, to go along with the gender gap in developer roles.  The powers that be want to get as big a pool of middle managers as possible to choose from, so they can start filling that gap.</p><p><img data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CFyrWEIWMAEMsD0.jpg" height="200" width="200"></p>

<p>Source: https://twitter.com/kthomas901/status/602544949347766272</p><p>Don't do it. Really, if you like to code, you will probably hate management. And even if you are not certain, I would still say, don't do it. Mostly because I'm selfish, and I would rather continue to address the gender gap in developer roles. One of the big reasons for that gender gap is the number of women who exit the field, before they can ever advance to "role model" or "mentor". Without more senior women developers as role models and mentors, the pressure to not hire young women developers, to allow "brogrammer" culture to flourish, or let those young women developers transition to "more appropriate" roles will continue.</p>

<p>I remember being a junior developer at Shell Canada. We were called "programmer analysts". Then you got a promotion to "analyst programmer" (I know, I know). After that came "systems analyst", "senior systems analyst", "staff systems analyst" and finally "senior staff systems analyst". This was known as the "technical" track. There was tremendous pressure, once you got even to "analyst programmer" to start considering "managerial" type roles. If not straight up management, then project management, etc. I resisted, because I wanted to be a developer. I love to create new things. I love to learn new technologies. I enjoy solving problems. I love to <em>code</em>. Really did not want to be a manager. Finally, my manager accepted that I wouldn't ever be a manager. So, I was set up for the "technical specialist" track. First new position in this track that was offered to me was... "You know this same technology that you've been working with for 4 years? Ya, so now we want to you move to a larger group, with more responsibility, more pressure, more users, and work with this same technology for the next 4 years". I declined. I wanted something new, something different to learn. My manager was 100% baffled, and could not understand why I refused to take the new position. I was 100% baffled as to why she couldn't see that it had zero appeal to me.</p>

<p>I continued to work at Shell for another couple of years. I even got to work on cool things, like a team researching which object oriented programming language we should be considering (C++ was in it's infancy, but we chose it. Good choice. Obj-C, Eiffel, Smalltalk, etc, wouldn't have been good corporate choices in the early 90's). In retrospect though, I know that my refusal to take that position was the beginning of the end of my career as a "corporate" developer. I couldn't convince myself to do what was "good for the company", when all I could see was that it would suck all the enjoyment of work out of me.</p>

<p>In the end, I volunteered to be laid off, during one of a series of down-sizing exercises. Many of my friends had been laid off in previous rounds, or quit in between. I ended up, based on a recommendation from a friend, at a little software company called WNDX. And here I am, over 20 years later, still programming. I mostly still love my work. Definitely there have been changes and periods of frustration. Every 7-10 years the landscape changes, and if you want to keep coding, you need to change with it. But then I always loved learning new things, so that's all to the good.</p>

<p>A few years ago I had lunch with a group of people that I used to work with and play darts with at Shell. Not one of those people could still be considered a developer. The ones who were still at Shell (some were already retired) were quite literally counting the days until their retirement, while lamenting the stupid little couple million dollar projects they were working on. I still think that I escaped just in time. Don't care how sweet that retirement plan was/is. Nothing can make up for working a job you hate for 20 years. </p>

<p>So, resist that temptation. If you love to code, then find ways to keep coding. Work towards being one of those mentors or role models that our industry needs so badly.</p>

      <title>Decidedly Jazz</title>
      <link>/blog/decidedly-jazz</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently came across a discussion on Twitter about how programming was part math and part jazz.  The jazz part, of course, is about improvisation.  I don't know, maybe we are all comedians?</p>
<p>Ok, the basics of the theory are like this.  We use basic building blocks, like musicians do, in order to build programs.  These building blocks are called "design patterns".  Just like music, we know that programs can be built without using design patterns, but they are generally more pleasing to read and understand if we do use them. These patterns are recognisable to other programmers with the same training and understanding.   </p>

<p>I remember attending the Toronto Jazz Festival, with my uncle, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/alone-together/id653166238">Don Vickery</a>, who happens to be a talented jazz drummer and teacher.  There was a French band up on the stage in front of city hall, that was... undoubtedly skilled and technically proficient.  But after a glance in my direction, my uncle leaned over towards me and said, "Yup, my toe is tapping to that one." In case it's not obvious to you, that was sarcasm.  Technical proficiency does not necessarily produce enjoyable music. I've seen the same thing in code. A talented programmer can write amazingly complex code to solve difficult problems, but that doesn't mean her code is easily readable or even understandable to novice programmers. </p>
<p>Everyone who programs is building something with their mind.  Like music, it may be a common melody, that tens or hundreds of composers have used before.  Or it may be the craziest new thing ever, that is totally unique to that programmer.</p>
<p>Of course, that is the beauty of building things with your mind.  Everyone's mind works differently.  We have schools of thought in programming, much like schools of music.  The programs written by people of a specific school will tend to be similar, and will definitely be more understandable to people of the same school.</p>
<p>But there is value in these differences.  I teach a couple of workshops, and I find the endless variations that my students come up with to solve the problems presented as exercises fascinating.  In two different workshops, I had a couple of sysadmins.  They both approached one of the problems (loading a file which had a couple of errors in it) in a way that was similar to each other, but totally unique compared to the rest of the class of primarily web developers.  Their minds work at solving these problems differently, because they have a different background and training, and the design patterns they commonly use in their work are different from the ones that web developers commonly use. That does not mean that their solutions are better or worse than the solutions of their fellow classmates.  They were just different.</p>
<p>That's part of what makes programming so interesting.  You can be trying to solve a problem, and bring in a coworker or pair to help out, and discover a completely new way to approach the problem, because your pair just thinks different.  That's incredibly valuable, and programmers who are "lone wolves" never experience this sort of revelation.</p>
<p>One of the strengths that I seem to bring to the table is that I can approach a problem from many different sides and points of view.  Sure, sometimes I get stuck, everyone does.  But having the flexibility to recognise that there is more than one approach, and having the mindset that allows me to flip from one to another to another is part of what makes me a good programmer.  And, I think, a good teacher.  If all you know is one way, and one of your students just "doesn't get it", because <em>their</em> mind doesn't work the same way as yours, it will result in an impasse, and a failure to teach.  It's not a failure to learn, just because their mind works differently.  As a teacher, you should open yourself to all the possible variations of solutions, so that when you encounter one of those students, you have other options to use, in order to help that student achieve understanding.</p>

Looking back though, it’s been two years (!?!) since I finished primary writing and submitted the final chapter for my reviewers to critique.</p>
<h2 id="core-data-in-motion-core-data-in-rubymotion-">Core Data in Motion = Core Data in RubyMotion </h2>

  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/580e9590725e25ff5489b011/1477350808919//img.png" alt=""/>
  

<p>Core Data is one of the more complex iOS frameworks, and it is made more obscure by the use of Xcode to visually construct models in most examples and tutorials. The fact remains, however, that you can do all of that in code without touching Xcode, using the Core Data API.</p>

  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/580e95cd725e25ff5489b3d8/1477350868043//img.png" alt=""/>
  

<p>Xcode image, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xcode_icon.png" title="Fair use of copyrighted material in the context of Xcode">Fair use</a>, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=14259496">Link</a></p>
<p>So really, my book is more like <em>Core Data in Code</em>.  That’s what you need, if you want to use <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com">RubyMotion</a> and your favourite editor and Ruby tools, instead of Xcode with all it’s assorted quirks. And, not withstanding the overall RubyMotion emphasis, the code-level focus of this book is valuable to iOS developers of all persuasions (Ruby, Objective C, Swift).</p>
<p>Since I wrote <a href="http://coredatainmotion.com">Core Data in Motion</a>, I’ve fielded a lot of questions from developers about topics not covered in the book, like managed contexts, concurrency, queries and migrations.</p>
<p>There have also been some updates to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/WhatNewCoreData2016/ReleaseNotes.html">Core Data API</a> itself. </p>
<p>And of course, the <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com">RubyMotion</a> team and community has continued to develop and improve Core Data related gems, and produced a framework (<a href="http://docs.redpotion.org/en/latest/">Red Potion</a>) that helps us write code that looks less like Objective C, and more like the Ruby we love.</p>
<p>So after two years, looks like it’s already time for a second edition of <a href="http://coredatainmotion.com">Core Data in Motion</a>.</p>

  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/50d2902fe4b0959a0871a12c/50d29312e4b04687d9db341b/580e96192e69cf6ad145222f/1477350948341//img.png" alt=""/>
  

<p>This won’t just be an incremental update, bolting a couple of new chapters to the end. I’ll be re-visiting each chapter, ensuring that the most recent Core Data API’s are used, and we’ll be updating to a completely new example app as well.</p>
<p>And this time, we’ll be covering <a href="http://docs.redpotion.org/en/latest/">RedPotion</a>, concurrency with managed object contexts, more complex queries with NSFetchRequest and NSPredicate, and we’ll introduce basic versioning and migrations.</p>
<p>Since this is a fairly significant update to a book already packed with over 120 pages of carefully researched code and examples, the cost of the book <em>will</em> be going up. The good news is that you can still purchase the old book for the next week (until the end of October) at the old price. All book purchasers will receive the 2nd edition <em>for free</em>. After this week however, sales of the book will cease until the first new chapter is available, and a higher price kicks in.</p>

Have you been asking yourself these questions: Do I have to use XCode to create a CoreData model?; How do relationships work in code work anyway?; How do I pre-load data into my CoreData store?; What is an NSFetchedResultsController, and why do I need one?</p><p>We'll delve into each of these questions, and review the surprisingly simple, elegant solutions that RubyMotion can provide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sound familiar? The Rails ecosystem has grown in leaps and bounds, like the Java ecosystem did in its’ early days. So many languages, frameworks, plugins, engines, libraries and tools. So little time to deliver your new project.</p><p>It’s tempting to hire a rock star who knows absolutely everything to get your new project off the ground. You can also hire "consultants" to help fill in the holes in your team when taking your existing product to the next level. Or maybe just hire a whole bunch of people for cheap, and they’ll get the job done... But did you ever consider the untapped wealth of the team you already have?</p><p>In this session we’ll explore ways in which the average development team can explore, learn, teach, and grow, until the sum of members of the team is as great as any Consultant or Rockstar.</p><p></p>
<h3>Mobile Rage</h3><p><a href="http://railsconf2012.com" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">RailsConf</a> - April 23-25, 2012 &nbsp;Austin, TX</p>

<p>Most of us have been there. That website you want to use, from your mobile device, that just refuses to cooperate. From the Flash-only, to the can't f**king log in, to the redirect-to-mobile-and-stay-there sites, there's more than enough websites out there to invoke Mobile Rage.</p><p>Although we all know that the best mobile development strategy is "mobile-first", we also all know how many sites and applications out there were designed and built by people who didn't imagine how fast mobile would take over.</p><p>Come learn about the common mistakes most people make for mobile, and some of the simple solutions you can use to help reduce Mobile Rage, without having to do a complete rewrite.</p><p></p>
<h3>Rails 3.1</h3><p><a href="http://confoo.ca/en" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">Confoo</a>&nbsp;February 29th - March 2nd, 2012 &nbsp;Montreal, QC<br></p>

<p>Another new version of Rails. Delightful. And terrifying. What's changed this time? Fear Not!</p><p>We'll be reviewing the changes and additions to Rails 3.1, giving you a walk-through of what it all means (asset pipeline, what?), in the context of a brand new app, and an older app that will need to be upgraded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maps are easy, right? Right. Except... when they aren't.</p><p>What about when you need to mix multiple data types on your maps?</p><p>What about when the simple solutions (paging) to complex problems (too much data) don't cut it with your users?</p><p>What about when your scaling problems exceed the bounds of all the available solutions?</p><p></p>

At the time, I was working with oil &amp; gas data every day (in the development of etriever.com and welltriever.com), and I was appalled at the idea people could have an abandoned well in their back yard, and not be aware of it.</span></p><div class="sqs-image sqs-empty"><div class="sqs-image-content" style="padding-bottom: 100.0%"></div></div><h3 id="map">Map</h3>
<p>The main view is a map view, of all the abandoned oil &amp; gas wells in Canada.  If the wells are too close together, they are displayed as a cluster, with the number of wells in the cluster prominently displayed.</p>

<p>All the wells currently displayed on the map can also be viewed as a list, with the UWI (Unique Well Identifier) and abandoned date.</p>

<p>There are several "interesting" locations listed, but you can search for any city or town, and it will appear in the list to be selected. Once selected, the map will zoom to this location.  </p>
