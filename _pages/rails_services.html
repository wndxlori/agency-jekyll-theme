                        Your client base is growing, and the demand for business relevant features keeps your
                        development team busier than ever. That team is under pressure to focus on the features
                        and bug fixes which are in demand from existing clients, and required to continue to build
                        that client base. It is inevitable that those features and bug fixes are prioritized at the
                        expense of the general upkeep and maintenance of your application infrastructure.
