            This is a multi-point Inspection of your Rails application. We'll identify any potential
            security issues (including a summary of possible entry points), list what gems need
            updating (or replacing), provide a test coverage report, and an initial code quality
            evaluation.

            With the Stabilizer, we include the full Rails Inspection PLUS
            %ul
              %li fix any serious security issues that have entry points in your application
              %li add or update your new developer bootstrap (bin/setup)
              %li add or update/cleanup your seed database
              %li set up or update your CI build
              %li update to the latest Rails bug fix release (for your current point version)

          %h3 Rails Renewal
          %h5 starts at $995/month
          %p
            After your application has been Inspected and Stabilized, let us take over your
            monthly Rails maintenance needs, ensuring that your app stays secure, and your gems
            are kept up-to-date. These updates will be made available as pull-requests for your
            team to review before applying, or we can apply them for you.  We will also branch and
            test on new Rails point version beta-tests, ensuring your application is ready to update
            as soon as a new release is available.

          %h5 starting at $2995/month
          %p
            Your client base is growing, and the demand for business relevant features keeps your
            development team busier than ever. That team is under pressure to focus on the features
            and bug fixes which are in demand from those clients, so it is inevitable that those tasks
            are prioritized at the expense of the general upkeep and maintenance of your application
            infrastructure.
          %p
            Unfortunately, continued neglect of your application frameworks, libraries, and toolsets
            comes at a cost. That cost is the slow build up of technical debt. Much like credit card
            debt, that technical debt continuously erodes the teamâ€™s ability to deliver on those
            priority features. As technical debt builds, so can developer frustration.
          %p
            Let us help Grind down that technical debt. We can address issues like
            %ul
              %li those left-over bits of previous Rails upgrades that were never completed (simplifying your code base)
              %li removing code (and gems) that are no longer used (making upgrades easier, test suites faster)
              %li replacing gems at EOL (and their potential security issues)

          %h3 Rails Bullet Train
          %h5 starting at $4995
          %p
            The dreaded Rails upgrade. Why task your team with a major infrastructure upgrade
            when our experienced Rails team are familiar with the common upgrade pitfalls? We can
            take over, identify potential issues, and bring your application up to date.
          %p
            We will generally require an Inspection & Stabilization of your application before
            embarking any major version upgrades. With the information compiled by those
            processes, we can provide an estimate with point-by-point details of the upgrade process
            before we start.
          %p
            After your application is upgraded, you can take advantage of our monthly Rails
            Renewal package to keep it up-to-date.
