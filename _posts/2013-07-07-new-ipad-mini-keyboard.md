This is a test of typing on the new Logitech Ultrathin keyboard cover for iPad mini.  OMG, this is really easy to use.

It has a really nice feel to it. Reminiscent of my old favourite DecTerm keyboards.  The 320 and 420 terminals had keyboards that I still miss after all of these years.

I suspect this will mean that I will be blogging more. It should also make writing some of the content for my new mini-ebook easier as well, which is great, because I want to pound that sucker out before the end of the summer.
