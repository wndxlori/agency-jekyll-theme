I've been trying to figure out a way to start bloggin more often, but I want to make sure that the time/value reading of my blog stays high. Today, I came up with an idea, so I'm going to try it out.

 It's a simple idea. Almost every day that I am coding, I spend a certain amount of time Googling, to find stuff to make my job easier. I don't like reinventing the wheel. Most days, I find multiple different solutions to problems. So, I'm going to blog, briefly, about the problems that I'm trying to solve, and the solutions that I found. Occasionally, I may even go off on a rant about finding *bad* solutions. 
 I hope that you find value in it. Let me know in the comments on my new posts.
