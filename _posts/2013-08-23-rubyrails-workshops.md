I've been struggling with trying to schedule my next 
[workshop](http://www.wndx.com).  I know there are lots of people interested, but we had to cancel the last one, because of insufficient signups, which was frustrating both for me, and for the people I had to let down by cancelling.


I'd really rather not do that again so I'm running a (really brief) survey, to see if we can figure out what would be the optimal time for scheduling the next workshop.


If you are in (or near) Calgary, and have thought about learning Ruby and/or Rails, please check out this survey and help me out?
