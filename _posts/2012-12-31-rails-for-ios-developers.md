Exciting news.  We've got 2 new sessions of the 
[Rails4iOS](http://rails4ios.com) workshop scheduled.  

>You've got your iPhone app almost ready to go, but now you need a website. You're an iOS developer, not a web developer, and every day that goes by is another day that your app ISN'T in the App Store. You can outsource your server-side development, but that costs both time & money. What if you could build your own website? Our Rails for iOS Developers Workshop will help you get your responsive website up and running, using the powerful Ruby on Rails framework, from creation to deployment, in straight-forward, easy to follow steps.


We are very pleased to be able to offer the workshop for the first time in San Francisco.  Since my co-instructor, Tim Breitkreutz, has relocated to SF, it seemed like a logical choice.

The first workshop will once again be offered in 
[Calgary, AB, on March 16-17, 2013](https://wndx.stagehq.com/events/1954).  The second is in 
[San Francisco, on April 6-7, 2013](https://wndx.stagehq.com/events/1953).

If you can't make it to either of those, then perhaps we might see you at 
[RubyConf AU](http://www.rubyconf.org.au/workshops), where we will be offering a condensed version of this workshop as a 
[one day workshop](#), for the insanely great deal of only A$95.
