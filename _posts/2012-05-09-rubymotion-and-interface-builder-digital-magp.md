--->So, all of the cool kids have been talking about 
[Laurent Sansonetti](http://chopine.be/)’s next project: 
[RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/), a port of MacRuby targeted at iOS. On the whole I’m pretty impressed with what you can already do with it. One of the issues that people having been mentioning though, is that you lose the ability to use Interface Builder with it, but this isn’t actually true!

This is a big step forward.  Of course, it would be way cooler to have StoryBoard support...
