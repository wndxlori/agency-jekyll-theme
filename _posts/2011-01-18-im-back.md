---Sorry for the long hiatus in updates. My personal reaction to winter in the frozen north (Calgary, AB, Canada) is to hibernate. But it's sunny and warmer today, and I feel like updating with some of the long list of Ruby & Rails problems & solutions I've been collecting in the mean time. 

Stay tuned. First one will be up shortly.
