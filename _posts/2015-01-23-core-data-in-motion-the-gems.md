At long last, 
[Core Data in Motion](http://coredatainmotion.com), my book that helps RubyMotion developers get up to speed with Core Data in their RubyMotion projects, is complete.


So, what is RubyMotion? 
[RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/tour/why-rubymotion/) enables you to write cross-platform applications for iOS, Android, and OS X in Ruby. Instead of using the painfully verbose syntax of Objective-C, or taking a chance on the not-quite-ready-for-production Swift language, you can use the programming language that was designed to make programming fun to develop your iOS applications.


And what is Core Data? Core Data is to iOS and OS X development what ActiveRecord is to Rails. It solves all the hard problems involved in your data stack. To quote 
[Drew Crawford](http://sealedabstract.com/code/you-should-use-core-data/)


>If you are saving more than 3 objects to disk without linking to CoreData.framework, youâ€™re doing it wrong.



This final chapter of Core Data in Motion is an epic look at the available gems and CocoaPods that can simplify and streamline your Core Data code. It weighs in at more that double the size of any of the other chapters in the book.


My reviewers have given fantastic feedback on this chapter, and I know you will find it extremely helpful, when trying to figure out which gem or CocoaPod will be most useful to speed along the development of your application.


Each gem is demonstrated, as I walk you through the process of transforming the base Core Data API's used in the book's sample project, into the gem's specific API. I also discuss the problems and issues I discovered along the way, so you can see what happens, and avoid those problems in your project.


It's been a long time coming, but Core Data in Motion will definitely give you the boost into using Core Data that you need, and save you hours and days of investigation and frustration.
