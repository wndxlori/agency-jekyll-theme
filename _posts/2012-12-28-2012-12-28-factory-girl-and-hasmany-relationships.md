Today I was trying to figure out how to create a factory girl model, with a has_many relationship. Â Turns out, this is not exactly straight-forward, and you need to <gasp> read the documentation.

You should look at the (excellent) example provided in the 
[Getting Started](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md#associations) document on the Factory Girl wiki.
