After taking the plunge with the inaugural 
[Year of Hustle Launch Class](http://unicornfree.com/prelaunch/), I've procrastinated long enough (my problem, not the class) with my own product launch, and am finally announcing the the official launch of 
[WNDXcasts](http://www.wndxcasts.com) - Mobile Web Development for regular web creators.

So, what's this all about?  After being a smart-phone owner throughout the initial phases of the landslide rush to mobile, I know exactly the kinds of problems people experience with visiting websites using their mobile phones.  I see those problems personally just about every day.  As a developer for many years, and a web developer more recently, I also know exactly what is involved in fixing most of those problems.  Some of it is so drop-dead easy that most website/web application creators would be embarrassed to think that they could have improved their customers' experiences so quickly.  Other issues just require a little more work, but it's still not that difficult.  And, at last we have the problems where you really need to dig in, and rewrite.  I aim to teach people how to do all that.
As you probably know, if you follow my blog, I'm not much of a writer.  I try, but writing isn't really my thing.  So, instead of writing about all this stuff, I'm creating screen-casts.  Videos that you can sit down and watch, following along with real examples and real source code, and immediately apply to your own website or web application.
If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, go to my 
[WNDXcasts](http://www.wndxcasts.com) website now, and sign up.  Everyone who signs up early will get extra special discounts when the first of the screen-casts becomes available in October.
