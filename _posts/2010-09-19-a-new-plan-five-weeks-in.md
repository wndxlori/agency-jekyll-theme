It was five weeks ago that I started working out regularly.  And keeping track of my caloric intake, using the SparkPeople iPhone app.  Five weeks in, and I haven't missed a single workout.  Had to juggle around a little, on busy weekends, but I'm proud of the fact that I didn't let myself slack off, just because I had a good excuse.

And I'm down 5 pounds.  It was 6, then I went overboard down in Lethbridge at my parents place for my birthday.  That's allowed, right?

What does all that translate to?  Improved energy levels.  In the evening, I no longer sit on my butt on the couch, because I'm completely exhausted.  I actually start to feel like getting up and getting stuff done, like some of those home improvement projects that I've been ignoring.  I also have noticed a bit of improvement in how my clothes fit. Looking forward to a major wardrobe overhaul.

Anyway, I won't bore you with weekly, or even monthly updates on my progress.  I'll just keep you posted on days like today, when I'm feeling smug about finally getting my butt in gear AND sticking with it.
