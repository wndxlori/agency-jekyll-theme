Thanks for all the follows and subscribes, based mainly on my Ruby and Rails problems and solutions series.  Since it has proven to be so popular, I have created a new, specific Posterous site - 
[ror4real](ror4real), where this series will continue, on a (hopefully) more regular basis. First new post is up today.

This site will once again be my personal ramblings, pictures, and tech talk, not always related to Ruby or Rails.  Feel free to unfollow, switch to the new site, or follow both if you'd like!
