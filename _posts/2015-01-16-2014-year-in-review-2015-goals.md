Last year was just crazy.  I was attempting to finish writing my book, work some contracts, speak at two conferences, teach my Rails workshop, mentor and teach at a couple of Ladies Learning Code/ChicGeekYYC events, and just for shiggles, my husband and I picked up and moved to a new (old) city - Lethbridge.


In retrospect, it isn't really surprising that I didn't actually finish primary writing on the book until Dec 31.  Other than finishing the book, and planning to move out of Calgary, I didn't really have a master plan last year.  And you know what they say about planning...

This year should be a little more sane.  I'm laying out some goals, and trying to concentrate on building up my "products" business, finally making progress on my 
[30x500](https://unicornfree.com/2015/guest-post-no-excuses-left-this-year-i-get-serious) learnings.


Before looking forward, however, I need to get an idea of where I currently stand. Taking the cue from some of my 
[fellow 30x500 alumni](https://unicornfree.com/2015/12-of-our-bootstrapping-students-to-watch-in-2015), I decided I should post my product business results from last year. Got onto 
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/ca), downloaded my transaction history, and summed everything up:

Ok, that % increase on the book is kind of lame, since I only sold one copy in Dec 2013, but the overall revenue numbers were still a nice uptick, year over year. I guess I’m still in that constant battle with impostor syndrome, and I didn’t keep track regularly, because I didn’t think I was doing that well, considering that I was still pretty much half-assing my way along last year.


Now I have the numbers on which to base my goals for the next year. Drum roll, please...


* Marketing the 
[Core Data in Motion](http://coredatainmotion.com) book


* Create new 
[Advanced Rails Workshop](http://www.wndx.com/workshops/)


* Schedule/deliver 
[Rails/Advanced Rails/Rails4iOS workshops](http://www.wndx.com/workshops/) quarterly


* Finish my damn iOS application - WIMBY


* Establish a 
[Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com) Lethbridge Chapter & and host at least one workshop


Marketing the now-finished (just waiting for comments from one more reviewer before pushing the final) book is pretty much a no-brainer.


Creating the new workshop is one of the "brick building" exercises we learn from 30x500, and is also a no-brainer, considering how many requests I have had for it.


Obviously, I can't make any money from workshops if I don't get them scheduled.  Seems like I get busy, and then forget, and then it's a bad time of year or whatever.  I mean... I scheduled a workshop on Grey Cup weekend one time (#facepalm).  So, we'll get those lined up, with real dates, sooner rather than later this year.


The iOS application is a bit of a soft goal.  I need to finish it, because it's been languishing at the 80% finished level for too long.  It's not really planned as a revenue generator, directly, but it was the spur behind my book, so there's that.  And then I can say I am a published iOS developer, so there's that, too.  iOS and Android developers seem to have a LOT of pains, so that is a fruitful area for future sales safaris.


I also want to continue my volunteer work in conjunction with Ladies Learning Code, to improve the levels of diversity in software development.  Lethbridge may be small, but it has both a university and a college, so I fully expect to be able to host workshops here quarterly, as I get the Lethbridge Chapter ramped up. (

So there we have it.  Last year I had a 300% increase in revenue.  I don't think it's a stretch to go for 500% this year (not a goal, but a good measuring stick of progress), since I am buckling down with these definite goals.  Instead of leaving my revenue checkup for the end of the year, this year I'll be doing that at least quarterly, so I can tell what sort of progress I am making.
