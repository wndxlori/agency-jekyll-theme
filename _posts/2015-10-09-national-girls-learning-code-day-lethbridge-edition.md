#Where I answer your National Girls Learning Code Day questions



##What is National Girls Learning Code Day all about?



It's about discovering a passion for learning about technology.


It's about experiencing the satisfaction that comes from being a builder/maker of the web and technology.


It's about building a simple one page website from scratch to share with friends and family.


And becoming more confident and self-assured and developing a willingness to try new things.


This is a beginner level workshop for girls 8-13 years old and their parent/guardian/aunt/older sibling.


##Can boys sign up?



These workshops are sponsored by 
[Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com), and this is 
[National Girls Learning Code Day](http://girlslearningcodeday.com/).  That said, as the local Lethbridge Chapter lead, I won't absolutely say no if a boy would really, really like to attend. But if he really wants to come, he should bring along a girl, too, like a sister or cousin or neighbourhood friend!


Or, boys can wait for our (not yet scheduled, but in the New Year) 
[Kids Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com/program/kids-learning-code/) workshop, which will be focused on kids of all ages, not just girls.


##What do we need to bring?



The learners will need to bring a laptop to work on to the workshop.  If you don't have one, but would really like to participate, please contact me at 
[this email](mail:lethbridge@ladieslearningcode.com), and I'll do my best to find one you can borrow for the day!


This workshop is BYOL, so each parent or guardian/youth pair will need to supply their own lunch as well.
