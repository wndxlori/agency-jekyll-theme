[today announced](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2010/may10/05-24PSTToolsPR.mspx) the availability of two new open source projects that complement technical 
[documentation recently released for](http://blogs.msdn.com/interoperability/archive/2010/02/19/New-Office-Documentation-Now-Publicly-Available.aspx) Microsoft Outlook Personal Folders (.pst). From the press release:

“
.”

The two open source projects, available on Copeplex under the Apache 2.0 license are the following:

*The PST Data Structure View Tool (
[http://pstviewtool.codeplex.com/](http://pstviewtool.codeplex.com/)) is a graphical tool allowing the developers to browse the internal data structures of a PST file. The primary goal of this tool is to assist people who are learning .pst format and help them to better understand the documentation.


*The PST File Format SDK (
[http://pstsdk.codeplex.com/](http://pstsdk.codeplex.com/)) is a cross platform C++ library for reading .pst files that can be incorporated into solutions that run on top of the .pst file format. The capability to write data to .pst files is part of the roadmap will be added to the SDK.

Maybe I can dig into those 10 yr old PST files that I archived, and see if there is anything else I need to dig out.
