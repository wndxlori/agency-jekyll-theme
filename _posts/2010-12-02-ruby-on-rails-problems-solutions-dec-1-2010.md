Lots of meetings today, so this is the short version.

 Git tips 
 For Mac users, this is a useful one. Getting git to ignore the .DS_Store files, everywhere, in one swell foop.

 Buttons with image/text 
 This is one of my personal bandwagons. Usability is generally increased, quite a lot, when you combine text and images for your action items (links, buttons, submits, whatever), instead of using text alone or images/icons alone. It's surprisingly hard to get these kinds of action items to work/look good in HTML. The following link is useful, if you are mostly dealing with ajax actions.

 And remember Rails folks, there is very little functional difference between a button_to with :remote and a link_to with :remote in Rails 3, so you can replace your buttons with these lovely links if you want to.
