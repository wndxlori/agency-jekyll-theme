Thanks to everyone who participated in my 
[Ruby Workshop survey](http://www.wndx.com/blog/rubyrails-workshops).  Although I didn't get a tonne of responses, the ones I did get formed some distinct patterns, so I got what I needed.


In general, you prefer weekends or don't care, so weekend it is.


You distinctly prefer November, with a secondary preference of January, so we'll schedule it that way.


No preferences emerged for location, so I'll just see what's available/comfortable/cheap. ;-) (One write in for Dubai/Muscatâ€¦ sorry, but probably not)


You really don't like "Mostly lecture", and lean strongly toward a mix of lecture and interactive work-along (which is what we've always done, good to know).


And last but not least, you want the straight up 
[Ruby on Rails for Real](http://ror4real.com) workshop most of all, followed by the 
[Rails for iOS Developers](http://rails4ios.com), so that will be what we schedule for November and January.  A reasonable number of people are wanting the Intro to Ruby as well, and I am certain that 
[Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com/events/location/calgary/) will be running that workshop again soon as well, so keep an eye out for that.  Oh, and I had one "write in" for RubyMotion.  That's on my radar for next year.


Thanks again. I'll post a schedule as soon as I've firmed up the dates. If you are not already on my 
[mailing list](http://mad.ly/signups/29211/join), please do
