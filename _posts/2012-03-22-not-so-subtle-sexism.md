--->You, person who told me to lighten up, saw one little thing. It didn't seem like a big deal, did it? One little line! One joke! One comment! But it's not just one thing to me: it's one of thousands that I've had to endure since I was old enough to be told that 'X is for boys!' It's probably not even the first thing I've had to deal with that day, unless you've gotten to me pretty early. 

That's the main problem with subtle discrimination. It leaves those that it affects the most powerless against it, quietly discouraging them. If they speak up, they're treated to eye rolls at the least, and at the worst, are called oppressors themselves. We're accused of not wanting equal rights, but of wanting tyranny. 

I would just like the million little barbs to stop, and I would like to not be told to 'lighten up'.

And, despite their apology (
[http://gklst.tumblr.com/post/19734620901/geeklist-and-a-public-apology)](http://gklst.tumblr.com/post/19734620901/geeklist-and-a-public-apology)), I did just ask GeekLi.st to cancel my account.

Why?  Because the apology is an attempt at misdirection, to avoid taking responsibility for their one truly indefensible action.  They not-so-subtly threatened her employment.  Not only is that not cool, but it's a statement on the way they think, and the way they will do business.  So, I want nothing more to do with Geekli.st.  Period.

If you agree, go ahead and cancel your account, too.
