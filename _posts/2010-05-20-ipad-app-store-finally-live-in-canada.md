--->Tech blogs, including 
[Mashable](http://mashable.com/2010/05/20/ipad-app-store-live-internationally/), are reporting that the iPad App Store is now live in Canada, the U.K., France, Australia and New Zealand even though the much-buzzed-about Apple tablet will not be available for international sale until May 28.

Canadian tech blog 
[IntoMobile](http://www.intomobile.com/2010/05/20/international-ipad-app-stores-go-live.html) confirmed that the U.S.-purchased iPad's could now be used to purchase apps directly on the devices. Until now, iPad owners who tried the App Store -- to purchase tablet-designed magazines, newspapers, games and other mobile applications -- were greeted with a notice that Apple's App Store was not supported in their countries. Those uses could purchase the apps through their computers and transfer them to the device.
